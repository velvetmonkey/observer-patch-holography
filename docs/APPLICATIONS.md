# OPH Applications

Public page: [omega.floatingpragma.io](https://omega.floatingpragma.io/).

OPH points at machines as well as equations. A finite device has a boundary.
It exposes measurements. Neighboring patches compare what they see. Mismatch
drives repair. Stable outcomes become records. OMEGA is the lab version of
that idea: physical chambers, labeled ports, control software, and exact
checks.

Four use cases follow. All four are low-cost implementation tracks under
active development. The links point to public material in this repository or
public OPH pages. The OMEGA hardware visualization is at
[omega.floatingpragma.io](https://omega.floatingpragma.io/). The local compute loop diagram is

## 1. Cheap Desktop Fusion Energy

The first use case is a closed-loop acoustic fusion cell. Think of a small
water-based cavity driven as an OPH patch. It tracks pressure modes, charge
separation, phase structure, wall conditions, and output heat. Those readings
become boundary records for a software control loop. The target is a cheap
500 W-class home-scale energy cell that stays at room temperature outside the
active reaction region.

OPH changes the fusion problem from brute-force plasma confinement to tight
boundary control in a small resonator. Geometry, drive phase, acoustic
collapse, charge structure, and thermal readout become variables in one repair
loop. The engineering challenge is clean repeatability: keep the useful
high-gain state alive long enough to measure real output.

The control loop is the important part. The cell is driven through a range of
frequencies, phases, and pulse shapes. Sensors watch for boundary states where
pressure, charge, heat flow, and wall response stop fighting each other. The
software keeps the good states, rejects states that fail the energy balance,
and searches nearby settings. In OPH language, the useful state is a local
fixed point of the patch, and the measured heat is accepted only when the
boundary records agree.

## 2. Desktop Room-Temperature Quantum Supercomputers

The second use case is room-temperature OMEGA compute hardware. OMEGA uses
cheap optical parts, shaped chambers, labeled ports, measured coupling, and
ordinary software checks. The chamber shifts the candidate distribution before
the computer spends work. For search problems, proof of work, factorization,
planted constraints, and exact-check tasks, the hardware proposes candidates
and the host verifies them.

The public SHA-256d paper gives the most aggressive target:
[Photonic Fixed-Point Consensus for SHA-256d Proof of Work](../extra/Photonic_fixed-point_consensus_for_SHA-256d_proof_of_work.pdf).
The paper's own sensitivity table sets the scale: the hypothetical
wave-overlap sampler regime corresponds to about 21 times one high-end ASIC,
roughly 1.6 years per solo block at current difficulty, and the measured
prototype loses to random search under a matched exact-verification budget.
The dramatic regimes in that table are conditional endpoints with no bench
measurement attached. The engineering path is challenging: cleaner optics,
tighter calibration, and repeatable full SHA-256d tests are needed. The OPH
reason the encoding is natural is simple. A hash search can be rewritten as
local constraint patches with shared collars, repair syndromes, and exact
verifier closure.

The hardware does not have to replace the verifier. It has to make the
verifier's job much smaller. The task is encoded as many local constraints.
Optical paths, phase relations, and chamber geometry bias the output toward
candidate strings with low mismatch. The computer checks every candidate
exactly, so wrong answers are cheap to reject. The win comes from changing the
candidate stream before brute-force search begins.

## 3. AGI From Cost-Effective OMEGA Components

The third use case is an AGI stack built from software agents plus OMEGA patch
modules. In OPH, cognition is patch-net fixed-point search. A thought is a
path through local patches. A decision, memory, perception, or insight is the
normal form reached after mismatch repair. The direct paper is
[Thinking as Patch-Net Fixed-Point Search](../extra/thinking_as_patch_net_fixed_point_search.pdf).

The software part handles language, memory, tools, and planning. OMEGA modules
act as proposal engines, critics, memory anchors, and self-read surfaces. The
important extra ingredient is record pressure. The system has to test itself
against the world and repair contradictions across time. In OPH terms,
cognition is recurrent observer-patch consensus with records.

The architecture is simple enough to picture. A software agent proposes a
problem split. Memory patches retrieve relevant records. Critic patches test
the pieces against goals, tools, and outside measurements. OMEGA modules can
act as physical proposal engines for hard search or pattern-completion steps.
The system accepts an action when enough independent patches agree, then writes
the result back into memory. This is the same loop as the physics: boundary
test, mismatch, repair, stable record.

## 4. Hoverbikes And Hoverboards

The fourth use case is local gravity and inertia manipulation for stable lift.
The demo target is easy to picture: a hoverbike or hoverboard that lifts
without a rotor column, jet plume, or road contact. The vehicle is treated as
a controlled federation of field patches, sensors, actuators, and records. The
lift state is a maintained normal form.

OPH treats this as geometry control. Gravity is the large-scale readout of
overlap geometry and repair. The dark-matter paper uses the same idea at
galaxy and cosmology scale: finite collars can carry an information-defect
stress correction. That correction is electromagnetically dark because it is a
record-repair remainder. It gravitates because it enters the effective
stress bookkeeping. In a settled galaxy it looks like a dark-matter or
MOND-like correction. In a device, the same principle becomes a local
engineering target.

A scale reading is a public record of how the payload, Earth, local screen,
and observer patch glue together. Changing weight means changing the local cut
data that enters this gluing problem. The target is the effective inertial and
gravitational readout, not the rest mass of the payload.

The body biases screen microphysics by acting as a boundary-condition engine.
It drives synchronized field patterns around the lifting frame and reads back
timing, force, phase, temperature, and inertial data. Those readings are the
patch boundary records. When the drive pattern is coherent, the device changes
which local screen states are stable near the payload. In OPH terms, it nudges
support-visible cuts, collars, modular-flow data, and local repair moves. A
useful lift state is the setting where the field state, timing references, and
mechanical readouts all agree on a lower effective weight.

The same rule that makes the OPH papers strict also makes the engineering
strict. A single sensor reading is cheap. A real effect has to survive load
cells, accelerometers, timing references, thermal controls, field probes, and
sham runs. Bad states look like vibration, electromagnetic pickup, heating, or
ordinary actuator force. Useful states have to show up across independent
records at the same time.

rules are part of the same stack.

## Common Pattern

All four use cases run the same OPH loop:

```text
bounded patch -> exposed boundary -> mismatch -> repair -> stable record
```

| Use case | OPH object | Machine role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fusion cell | Acoustic and thermal patch consensus | Hold a high-gain local energy fixed point |
| Desktop supercomputer | Optical candidate enrichment | Bias hard search before exact verification |
| AGI | Recurrent self-reading patch federation | Stabilize thought, memory, self-model, and action |
| Hoverbike or hoverboard | Local geometry and field readout | Maintain a stable lift normal form |

OMEGA is the public hardware body for the loop. The papers provide the theory,
scorebooks, and evidence discipline. The applications use the same
patch-consensus machinery on energy, compute, intelligence, and lift.
