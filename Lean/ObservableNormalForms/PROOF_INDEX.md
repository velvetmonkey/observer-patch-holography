## Exact observable fibers

| Paper result | Lean declaration | Status | Scope |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Universal property, (a) ↔ (b), `thm:universal` | `observableDetermined_iff_unique_partialNormalizer` | ✅ | Unique proof-carrying `Option` normalizer, including obstruction, fixed-point, soundness, and boundary-extensionality clauses. |
| Universal property, (a) ↔ (c) | — | ⬜ | Image-subtype bijection is standard but not encoded. |
| Reachable normal forms live in the observable fiber, `prop:reachable-fiber` | `reachable_normalForm_mem_fiber` | ✅ | Reflexive-transitive closure, one-step observation preservation, and exact normal-form completeness. |
| Empty/singleton alternative, `cor:empty-singleton` | `empty_fiber_no_reachable_normalForm`; `singleton_fiber_forces_normalForm`; `singleton_fiber_weakNormalization_confluent` | ✅ | All three clauses; weak normalization is assumed only on the singleton fiber. |
| Audited terminal alternative, `thm:audited-terminal` | `existsUnique_auditedTerminal` | ✅ | Unique terminal, preserved observation, and consistency iff the input fiber is realizable, under exactly the current theorem hypotheses. |
| Observation-leak separation example | `ObservationLeakCounterexample.singleton_fiber_insufficient_without_observation_preservation` | ✅ | Complete three-state system with a singleton consistent fiber whose rewrite escapes to another observation class. |

## Observation-relative endpoint uniqueness

| Weak-normalization endpoint existence | `exists_equivalent_observer_endpoints` | ✅ | Every equally observed source pair has at least one pair of normal endpoints, which are equivalent; universal comparison is supplied by the preceding iff theorem. |
| Fine/coarse two-bit separation | `TwoBitRepair.observerEndpointUnique`; `TwoBitRepair.exists_equal_endpoints`; `TwoBitRepair.coarse_confluent`; `TwoBitRepair.coarse_boundary_does_not_identify`; `TwoBitRepair.coarse_observerEndpointUnique_fails` | ✅ | Complete one-step repair system with a protected bit: the relation remains same-source confluent, while discarding the protected bit fails both boundary identification and cross-source endpoint uniqueness. |

## Observational stability

## Directional scatter-project compiler (repo issue #626; #328 is the closed negative baseline)

These entries track repository issue #626 rather than a manuscript label. All
theorems are scoped to **certified layouts / compiler images**
(`Scatter.Layout.Cert`), not to arbitrary scatter-project states.

| Result | Lean declaration | Status | Scope |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Frozen directional output-only rule (route 1) | `Scatter.Layout.round` | ✅ | Definition; single write port per patch is type-level. |
| Intertwiner: one directional round = one ranked synchronous step | `Scatter.Layout.round_eq_synchronousStep`; `Scatter.Circuit.compile_intertwiner` | ✅ | Every register state of a certified layout / compiled circuit; reuses `RankedSynchronousSystem`. |
| Depth-bounded settling, fixedness, zero mismatch, uniqueness, noise recovery | `Scatter.Layout.evolve_settles`; `round_solution`; `totalMismatch_solution`; `totalMismatch_eq_zero_iff`; `zeroMismatch_unique`; `noise_recovery`; circuit instances `Scatter.Circuit.compile_settles` etc. | ✅ | Certified layouts; settling time is the rank bound (= circuit depth). |
| Resource formulas | `Scatter.Circuit.compile_regCount`; `compile_patchCount` | ✅ | registers = wires, patches = gates, rounds = depth. |
| Directional rule is an admissible member of the canonical projection family | `Scatter.Layout.round_eq_canonical_outputOnly`; `outputOnlySelection_isAdmissible` | ✅ | Certified layouts. |
| #328 regression: depth-two AND chain settles, without special-casing | `Scatter.regression_settles` (instantiation); `regression_reaches_target` (kernel); `regression_unique_zero_mismatch` | ✅ | Compiled `andChain`, start `(w,out) = (0,1)`. |
| #328 separation kept as its own negative result | `Scatter.sel328_isAdmissible`; `canonical_never_settles_328`; `canonical_scatter_project_not_settling_328` | ✅ | Existence of an admissible canonical selection with a mismatch-positive period-two orbit; does not claim all canonical members fail. |
| Negative controls (guards watched failing) | `Scatter.collide_no_cert`; `collide_order_dependent`; `latch_no_cert`; `latch_never_zero_mismatch`; `latch_no_fixed_point`; `selfLoop_no_cert`; `selfLoop_never_zero_mismatch`; positive control `fanOut_settles_kernel` | ✅ | Write collision, two-register cycle, self-loop; read fan-out settles. |

Explicitly not formalized:

- asynchronous ranked-functional update counts and the path-gain estimate;
- linear quotient/rank/singular-value results;
- succinct complexity classifications.
