# Observer-Patch Holography — Lean 4 umbrella root

Re-exports Jonathan Hill's concrete carrier/dynamics modules, the neutral
observation-determined normal-forms proof package, and the explicit bridge
between them.

**Status: preliminary skeleton rather than theorem-grade formalisation of
Proposition 4.2** from *Paradise as Fixed-Point Consensus*. The `Primitives`
module declares sorry-bearing signatures for
the OPH primitives (Records, Repair, Patch, Obs, Φ, gauge equivalence,
OPH-Confluence, OPH-Completeness) — these structurally depend on the
companion paper *Reality as a Consensus Protocol*.

The `BridgeEquivalence`, `CapacityFixedPoint`, and `SeedPi` modules carry
the Part-A coupling-algebra layer: the bridge count/tick equivalence, the
capacity fixed-point uniqueness schema, and the CAP-P seed statement. They
formalise the algebraic layer only; the physical identities I1/I2 are
outside the formalised set.

See `../README.md` and `../PROOF_INDEX.md` for scope and completion tracking.
