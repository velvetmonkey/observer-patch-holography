# Issue #544, operator layer: the collar clause made expressible — and proved
# independent of the algebraic core of the stated laws

The previous module (`CollarClause.lean`) proved the central-interface collar
clause is invisible to the overlap-consistency layer: repair factors through
the constraint family, which cannot express centrality. This module supplies
the **minimal abstract algebraic interface** on which the clause *is*
expressible, states it, and settles force-or-independence at that level.

## The interface (what the clause quantifies over — nothing else)

The clause (compact paper, `par:cicclause`, stated with Axiom 3
`ax:maxent`): *for every collar cut `Σ`, every retained density whose
support meets both half-collars acts through the boundary-charge (flux)
functions in `π_L(Z(C*(K̂_Σ)))`, while all remaining terms are one-sided
`K̂_Σ`-invariant operators.* Its ingredients, abstracted to pure ring
algebra (HARD RAIL: no C*-analysis, no GNS/spectra/Hilbert spaces):

* `A` — the pre-quotient collar operators, an abstract (noncommutative)
  ring;
* `K : Subring A` — the realized image of the boundary-symmetry algebra
  `C*(K̂_Σ)` (`prop:regulatedrealization`);
* `ML, MR : Subring A` — the one-sided algebras of `thm:msaderivation`'s
  interface normal form (`A ∪ B_L` side, `B_R ∪ D` side), commuting
  elementwise (screen-net locality, `ax:screen`), with `K` inside the
  collar algebra they generate;
* `Invariant a` — `K̂_Σ`-invariance, i.e. membership in the commutant of
  `K`; `Flux` — the center `Z(K) = K ∩ K′`; `CrossCut a` — support meets
  both half-collars, i.e. `a ∉ ML ∪ MR`.

A `RetainedFamily` packages exactly the algebraic stipulations Axiom 3
places on the retained constraint list (`ax:maxent`): a **finite** list of
**gauge-invariant** (= `K̂`-invariant) **collar-supported** densities,
together with a family of admissible refinement channels (additive maps —
CP coarse-graining maps are *not* multiplicative, so `RingHom` would be
unfaithful strength) under which the list is **refinement-closed** (the
operator-level shadow of the refinement-closure clause: coarse-graining
generates nothing outside the retained span).

## Faithfulness notes (scope, stated up front)

1. `Flux = Z(K)` is in general a *superset* of the paper's
   `π_L(Z(C*(K̂_Σ)))` (image-of-center ⊆ center-of-image). Refuting
   membership in the superset therefore refutes the paper's form, and the
   positive witness below lands in the smaller set too (its `K` is
   commutative, so the two coincide). No overclaim in either direction.
2. Only the **algebraic core** of Axiom 3 is shadowed. The state-side /
   analytic content (MaxEnt selection, closure-defect trace norms,
   realized-branch persistence) is *not* formalised here, and every claim
   below is scoped accordingly.
3. The representation-theoretic descent of `lem:onesideddescent` (Schur)
   and the MSA derivation of `thm:msaderivation` are **not** re-derived —
   that is #543, already done, and out of bounds for #544.

## The verdict: INDEPENDENCE (machine-checked two-model exhibit)

Two retained families over **one** collar layer `modelLayer` — the
algebraic double of the pinned failure mode in
`code/collar_alignment/test_msa_characterizations.py`
(`test_descent_invariant_but_noncentral_interface_breaks_alignment`:
"invariance alone is not the clause; centrality is"), over integer
matrices `M₂(ℤ) ⊗ M₂(ℤ)`:

* `posFamily` (= the paper's *lattice-gauge-type regulator*, which
  "satisfies the clause manifestly"): its single cross-cut density is the
  boundary charge `uu = u ⊗ₖ u ∈ Z(K)` — a genuine cross-cut **flux**
  term, so `CollarClause` holds non-degenerately
  (`collarClause_posFamily`).
* `negFamily` (= the paper's failure boundary, the Bell-pair-type
  coupling): adds `XX = X ⊗ₖ X`, which **satisfies every stated law** —
  it is `K̂`-invariant (`uu * XX = XX * uu`: the coupling respects the
  boundary symmetry, exactly the pinned test's group-averaged cross term)
  and collar-supported — yet is cross-cut and **not** in `Z(K)`; so
  `CollarClause` fails (`not_collarClause_negFamily`).

Hence (`collarClause_independent_of_axiom3_core`): the stated algebraic
laws admit both a central-interface and a non-central-interface retained
family — the collar clause is **not a consequence of the algebraic core of
the stated laws** and stays exactly what the paper declares it to be: a
named axiom-level input of the declared branch. Sharper
(`collarClause_not_layer_determined`): the two families share one layer,
so *no predicate of the layer data whatsoever* — in particular nothing
derivable from overlap-consistent repair, which by `CollarClause.lean`
reads only constraint data — can express the clause.

## Refinement-closure scoping (required honesty)

Axiom 3 calls the closure clause "a *substantive* renormalization
condition on the realized branch" and simultaneously stipulates "choose
**any** family of refinement channels compatible with the axiom"
(`ax:maxent`, and the channel choice in the refinement lemma). Both
witnesses below discharge closure with the identity channel, which the
"choose any channels" clause admits — a *legal* choice, so the
independence is valid. But this must not be read as "closure is
toothless": the correct reading is that **the collar clause is not forced
by the stated laws when the channel family is a free choice**. Forcing it
would require additional content the algebraic core lacks — either fixed
nontrivial coarse-graining channels under which closure bites, or
state-side/analytic content. That localisation of the missing force is the
result; the paper's open derivation target (`rem:msascope`) is thereby
narrowed, not closed. Issue #544 is NOT closed by this module.

No `sorry`, no `native_decide`, no new axiom.

/-! ## No-go addendum (#544): force-by-coarse-graining is OBSTRUCTED at the
algebraic layer

The independence above says the algebraic core does not *entail* the collar
clause. The results below say more: the concrete algebraic routes by which a
coarse-graining derivation could try to *force* it are each obstructed.

1. **Span-closure preservation.** The faithful semantics of the
   refinement-closure clause is closure of the additive *span* of the
   retained densities (the exponential family is generated by Lagrange
   combinations, so `0`, sums, and negations of retained densities are
   retained directions — a multiplier set to zero is still in the family).
   The Finset-level law already implies span-level closure
   (`RetainedFamily.spanClosed`), and *any* additive channel mapping the
   retained generators into the span preserves span-closure
   (`negFamily_spanClosed_of_maps_into`). In particular a channel that
   *annihilates* the non-central coupling leaves the family span-closed
   (`killing_XX_preserves_spanClosure`): **killing a coupling is not
   forbidding the direction** — closure failure cannot be the mechanism
   that excludes `XX`.

2. **ℤ-integrality obstruction.** The canonical excluding object would be a
   conditional-expectation shadow: an additive retraction of the collar
   ring *onto* the flux subring (fixing it pointwise). None exists over `ℤ`
   (`no_integral_flux_retraction`): the sector projector
   `p₊ = (1 + uu)/2` exists as an integer *matrix* (`pPlus`) but is a
   strictly half-integral combination of the flux generators, so additivity
   forces `E p₊ = (1+uu)/2 ∉ ℤ·1 + ℤ·uu`. This is the algebraic shadow of
   the division-by-dimension in the C*-conditional expectation — the
   precise sense in which the genuine excluding map lives in the barred
   state-side layer. A fortiori no such retraction additionally kills `XX`
   (`no_integral_flux_expectation_killing_XX`). Unitality (fixing the flux
   subring pointwise) is load-bearing: *without* it the obstruction
   disappears (`exists_integral_nonunital_idempotent` — a counterexample
   receipt, NOT an admissible channel).

3. **Channel-undeterminability.** No predicate of the layer *plus* the
   refinement-channel data is equivalent to the clause
   (`collarClause_not_channel_determined`, strengthening
   `collarClause_not_layer_determined`): the two witnesses share the layer
   AND the channel set, differing only in the retained list.

**Honest scope / named meta-boundary.** These no-gos obstruct the concrete
algebraic routes: closure-failure exclusion, integral
conditional-expectation shadows, and layer- or channel-definable
predicates. They do NOT prove the universal "no admissible channel can ever
force the clause" — stating that universal requires a formal class of
admissible coarse-graining channels, which is exactly the state-side
(CP/trace/normalization) content this layer deliberately does not shadow.
That universal remains a named meta-boundary; any forcing derivation must
cross it. -/

/-! ## Equivariant-universal no-go (#544): closure under ANY fixed
equivariant channel family cannot force the clause

The no-gos above kill the concrete algebraic forcing routes one at a time.
This section proves the universal statement over an honestly-statable
channel class: the **equivariant channels** — additive, unital,
`Ad(K̂_Σ)`-equivariant endomorphisms. The class is defined FIRST,
witness-free (it references only the boundary charge `uu`, never the
refuting coupling or centrality), and is a genuine algebraic shadow of the
framework's admissible coarse-grainings (gauge covariance and linearity are
uncontroversial admissibility requirements; positivity/trace-preservation
are the state-side residue).

**The two halves of the dimension count** ("invariant sector has rank 8,
the clause-compliant sector only rank 4"), each *proven*, not asserted:

* `closure_E8_eq_invariantPart` — the eight even matrix units `E8` span
  the invariant sector `V₊` exactly (both inclusions; the ⊇ direction is
  the load-bearing decomposition: an invariant matrix has vanishing odd
  entries and is an integer combination of the even units).
* `collarClause_family_misses_invariant_unit` — every clause-compliant
  retained family lies inside the kernel of the `((0,1),(1,0))` entry
  functional (one-sided elements and flux elements all vanish there), so
  it can never reach the invariant unit `E0110`; hence
  (`collarClause_family_not_spanning`) no clause-compliant family spans
  the invariant sector. This is the `8 > 4` separation in ℤ-module form.

**The universal no-go** (`equivariant_closure_cannot_force`): for EVERY
family `C` of equivariant channels simultaneously, the full
invariant-sector family `E8` is a legal `RetainedFamily` with
`refineChannels = C` — equivariance forces each channel to preserve the
invariant sector, which `E8` spans, so refinement closure holds — and it
violates the collar clause (`E0110` is cross-cut and not a flux term). So
closure under a fixed equivariant channel family, no matter which, cannot
exclude non-central cross-cut couplings. (Unitality is not even needed by
the proof; the result covers the wider non-unital equivariant class.)

**Honest scope (non-negotiable).** This is a no-go over the *equivariant*
class — a genuine algebraic channel class, but NOT the full admissible
class. The universal over all admissible channels remains the state-side
meta-boundary (branch selection, relative entropy, I-projections); this
brick does not touch it, and issue #544 stays open. -/

/-- **THEOREM (equivariant-universal no-go).** For EVERY family of
    equivariant channels simultaneously, there is a legal retained family —
    the full invariant sector `E8` — that is refinement-closed under all of
    them and violates the collar clause. Closure under a fixed equivariant
    channel family, no matter which, cannot force the clause. (The proof
    uses only equivariance, not unitality, so the wider non-unital
    equivariant class is covered too.) Honest scope: this quantifies over
    the equivariant class only; the universal over all admissible channels
    remains the state-side meta-boundary, untouched here. -/
