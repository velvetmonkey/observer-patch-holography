# Lüders conditioning

The Lüders update rule for conditioning a state on an event:

* `EventAlgebra.luedersUpdate` — `ρ ↦ (Tr(ρ P))⁻¹ • (P ρ P)`;
* the update is again a state whenever the Born weight is nonzero
  (equivalently: has strictly positive real part);
* **repeatability** — the conditioned state assigns weight `1` to the
  conditioning event;
* **idempotence** — conditioning twice on the same event equals
  conditioning once;
* **compatibility** — for commuting events, sequential conditioning
  composes to conditioning on the product event, hence is
  order-exchangeable;
* the **classical restriction** — when the state commutes with the event,
  the update is the normalised restriction `(Tr(ρ P))⁻¹ • (ρ P)`.

## Tagging convention

As in `EventAlgebra.Basic`: each lemma is tagged **algebra-only** (pure
`*`-algebra content) or **consumes a tracial state** (content passing
through the trace pairing). Everything about `luedersUpdate` consumes the
trace through its normalising Born weight.

## Conditioning as one-step convergence to a fixed point

Repeatability and idempotence assemble into a fixed-point description of
measurement.  For an event `P`, call a state **certain of `P`** when it
assigns `P` Born weight `1` (`certainStates`).  Then:

* conditioning any state of nonvanishing weight lands in `certainStates P`
  in a single step (`luedersUpdate_mem_certainStates`);
* on `certainStates P` conditioning is the identity
  (`luedersUpdate_eq_self_of_mem_certainStates`), so every element is a
  fixed point of the update map; and
* conversely, among states of nonvanishing weight the fixed points of
  conditioning on `P` are *exactly* the states certain of `P`
  (`luedersUpdate_eq_self_iff`).

Conditioning on `P` is thus a retraction of the states of nonvanishing
weight onto its own fixed-point set `certainStates P`: measurement update
is convergence to a fixed point, reached after one step.

weight `1`. -/

/-- **Consumes a tracial state.** A state that is certain of `P` is
supported on `P`: the state matrix absorbs the event on either side.  The
proof compresses the state by the complement `1 - P`, whose Born weight
vanishes; positive semidefiniteness of the zero-trace compression
`(1-P) σ (1-P)` forces it to vanish, and Cauchy–Schwarz for the state's
quadratic form then kills `σ (1-P)` itself. -/
