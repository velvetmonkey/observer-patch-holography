# Finite event algebras: events, states, Born weights

This module develops the elementary theory of finite-dimensional quantum
event algebras over `Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℂ`:

* `EventAlgebra.IsEvent` — an **event** is a Hermitian idempotent
  (an orthogonal projection);
* `EventAlgebra.IsState` — a **state** is a positive-semidefinite matrix of
  trace one (a density matrix);
* `EventAlgebra.bornWeight` — the **Born weight** `Tr(ρ P)` of an event `P`
  under a state `ρ`, with reality, nonnegativity, normalisation, additivity
  on orthogonal events, the complement bound `≤ 1`, and monotonicity under
  subevents.

Nonnegativity and the upper bound are stated in the partial order of `ℂ`
(`0 ≤ z ↔ 0 ≤ z.re ∧ z.im = 0`), which is strictly stronger than the
real-part statements; real-part corollaries are provided.

## Tagging convention

Every lemma in this development is tagged in its doc comment as either
**algebra-only** (a statement about the `*`-algebra of events, consuming no
state or trace functional) or **consumes a tracial state** (a statement
whose content passes through the trace pairing `(ρ, P) ↦ Tr(ρ P)`).

This module is deliberately free of any interpretational vocabulary: it is
plain finite-dimensional operator algebra.
