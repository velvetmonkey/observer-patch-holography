# The expectation functional of a state

The linear functional `M ↦ Tr(ρ M)` attached to a state `ρ`:

* it is additive and homogeneous in the observable;
* it is **positive**: nonnegative on every positive-semidefinite
  observable (not merely on events);
* it is **normalised**: it sends `1` to `1`;
* the Born weight is its restriction to events
  (`bornWeight_eq_expectation`).

## Tagging convention

As in `EventAlgebra.Basic`. Every lemma here consumes a tracial state: the
functional *is* the trace pairing.

cycling the trace, `Tr(ρ M) = Tr((V⋆ ρ V) D)` is a sum of products of
nonnegative diagonal entries. This strengthens `bornWeight_nonneg` from
events to arbitrary positive-semidefinite observables. -/
