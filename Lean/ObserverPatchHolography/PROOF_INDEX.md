# Proof-to-Paper Index

Mapping between Lean 4 theorems in this project and statements in
*Paradise as Fixed-Point Consensus* (B. Müller, 2026; source in
`paper/paradise_as_fixed_point_consensus.tex`).

## Completion summary

- **Proposition 4.2 (theorem-grade): 0 / 9 obligation families formalised → 0%**
  (2 Prop-4.2 statements + Lyapunov termination/descent +
  OPH confluence + repair completeness + `repair_respects_gauge`
  quotient descent + `gaugeEquiv_equivalence` + `Φ`-formula match +
  quotient/NF construction)
- **Definition 4.1 (Public world): 0 / 11 Lean items built → 0%**
  (3 carrier types + repair-site/local-step package + 1 global repair +
  1 potential + 1 gauge relation + equivalence proof + congruence proof +
  2 quotient/NF construction items)
- Abstract-rewriting skeleton (preliminary): 5 / 5 proofs → 100%
- OPH primitives (declared, sorry-bearing): 0 / 10 discharged → 0%
- Part-A coupling algebra (`BridgeEquivalence.lean`, `CapacityFixedPoint.lean`,
  `SeedPi.lean`): 13 / 13 lemmas, sorry-free → 100%
  (algebraic layer of the coupling theorem only; no physical-derivation
  content, the physical identities I1/I2 are outside the formalised set;
  does **not** bear on the Prop 4.2 / Def 4.1 counts)
- #304 boundary-fiber carrier witness (`Rule90.lean`, PR #385): 5 / 5 theorems, sorry-free → 100%
  (first non-degenerate `Hfib` discharge on a linear information-set carrier +
  `H1`–`H3` local-repair no-go; a carrier-level witness only. It does **not** bear
  on the Prop 4.2 / Def 4.1 counts above, which remain 0%)

The headline number is **0% of Proposition 4.2** until the OPH-specific
structures are in place. The 100% skeleton number is preliminary
infrastructure, not progress on Prop 4.2 itself. Counts revised per
math-seat audit (2026-05-19): previous "3+2" undercounted by ≈3×.

## Status legend

- ✅  proven, sorry-free, matches paper statement
- 🟡  proven but generic (does not yet refer to OPH structure)
- 🔸  motivational only (no formal anchor in paper)
- ⬜  declared as `sorry` or thin placeholder / not yet formalised
- ❌  stated, contains unintended `sorry` or `admit`

## Definition 4.1: Public world

> `World = NF(x) / ∼_gauge`, where `NF(x)` is the terminal state reached by
> accepted repair and `∼_gauge` identifies hidden local presentations with
> the same declared observable overlap data.

Paper: `paper/paradise_as_fixed_point_consensus.tex` §4, lines 305–313.

| `OPH.Repair`, `OPH.localRepair`, `OPH.acceptedStep` | `Primitives` | ⬜ | "Built from local recovery moves" (line 297), composed under asynchronous schedules in OPHConsensus. |
| `OPH.Φ` | `Primitives` | ⬜ | Concrete formula `Φ(x) = Σ_e w_e · d_e(π_{i,e}(x_i), π_{j,e}(x_j))` (line 300). |

## Proposition 4.2: Fixed-point reading of reality

> `World ∈ Fix(Repair)`, `Repair(World) = World`, and (under confluence +
> completeness) terminal public state is independent of update schedule on
> the physical quotient.

Paper: `paper/paradise_as_fixed_point_consensus.tex` §4, lines 321–328.

| Lean name | Module | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `OPH.Confluence` | `Primitives` | ⬜ | OPH-specific confluence hypothesis (line 326); per OPHConsensus. |
| `OPH.LyapunovDescent` | `Primitives` | ⬜ | Strict descent of accepted repairs; OPHConsensus uses this plus finite state/value range for termination. |
| `OPH.Termination` | `Primitives` | ⬜ | Termination of the accepted-step relation; not implied by repair completeness. |
| `OPH.Completeness` | `Primitives` | ⬜ | Normal forms are exactly consistent states; per OPHConsensus Assumption `ass:complete`. |
| `OPH.world_is_fixedPt` | (TODO) | ⬜ | `Repair(World) = World` on the physical quotient. |
| `OPH.schedule_independence` | (TODO) | ⬜ | Under `Confluence ∧ Completeness`, terminal public state is independent of update schedule on the physical quotient. |

## Abstract-rewriting skeleton (preliminary)

Generic results over `r : X → X → Prop` and `T : X → X`. Verified
sorry-free. These are the abstract layer the OPH
proof instantiates after the concrete repair layer is supplied.

| Lean name | Module | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `OPH.AbstractRewriting.newman_lemma` | `AbstractRewriting` | 🟡 | Terminating + locally confluent → confluent. Generic. |
| `OPH.AbstractRewriting.unique_normal_form` | `AbstractRewriting` | 🟡 | Confluent → unique normal forms. |
| `OPH.AbstractRewriting.newman_unique_nf` | `AbstractRewriting` | 🟡 | Combined: terminating + locally confluent → unique normal forms. |
| `OPH.AbstractRewriting.deterministic_full` | `AbstractRewriting` | 🟡 | Deterministic op with descent potential → unique fixed-point reached. |
| `OPH.AbstractRewriting.fixedPt_zero_potential` | `AbstractRewriting` | 🔸 | Any fixed point of a repair op has `Φ = 0`. **No paper anchor**: the passage at lines 330-334 is prose, not a labelled corollary; paper makes no formal `Φ(W) = 0` claim. Kept as preliminary ARS decoration only. |

## #304: Boundary-fiber observer uniqueness: Rule 90 carrier witness

> `Hfib`: within a fixed boundary fiber, consistent states are a gauge-singleton
> the hypothesis binder of `boundary_fiber_observer_unique` (`Primitives.lean`).

Instantiated on a linear (Rule 90) two-patch carrier, the first case where the
`#304` `Hfib` binder is non-degenerate (a proper, failable information set + a
non-trivial gauge), unlike `demoCarrier`'s seed tautology. A carrier-level
witness, **not** a Prop 4.2 / Def 4.1 item. Module:
`Source/ObserverPatchHolography/Rule90.lean` (PR #385). Sorry-free, standard axioms
only (`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`; no `native_decide`).

| Lean name | Module | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `OPH.rule90_Hfib_good` | `Rule90` | ✅ | Reading bottom cells {0,1} discharges `Hfib` on the consistent set, instantiating the `boundary_fiber_observer_unique` binder. |
| `OPH.rule90_Hfib_bad_fails` | `Rule90` | ✅ | Reading {0,2} fails: same carrier, coarser boundary. `Hfib` is about *which* cells `B` reads, not how many. |
| `OPH.rule90_gauge_nontrivial` | `Rule90` | ✅ | Seeds (0,0,0), (1,0,1) observably identical: the gauge contains `ker(Rule90)` (kernel-pair exhibit). |
| `OPH.rule90_no_frustrationFree_repair` | `Rule90` | ✅ | No `H1`–`H3` local repair exists on this carrier. Scope: transactional/multi-patch repair and relaxed `H2` are **not** ruled out. |
| `OPH.rule90t_outer_eq` | `Rule90` | ✅ | Helper: every Rule 90 image has equal outer cells. |

## Part-A coupling algebra (algebraic layer)

Formalises the ALGEBRAIC layer of the OPH coupling theorem: the bridge
count/tick equivalence, the capacity fixed-point uniqueness schema, and the
CAP-P seed statement. No physical-derivation content is formalised; the
physical identities I1/I2 (which give the two sides of the bridge their
physical readings) are outside the formalised set. The numeric interval
enclosures stay in the Python certificates (`code/capacity_readback/`,
`code/P_derivation/`); no floating-point numerics enter Lean. All 13 lemmas
are sorry-free with standard axioms only (`propext`, `Classical.choice`,
`Quot.sound`). Not a Prop 4.2 / Def 4.1 item.

Modules: `Source/ObserverPatchHolography/BridgeEquivalence.lean`,
`Source/ObserverPatchHolography/CapacityFixedPoint.lean`,
`Source/ObserverPatchHolography/SeedPi.lean`. Status marks refer to the
coupling-algebra statements, not to *Paradise* anchors.

| Lean name | Module | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `OPH.BridgeEquivalence.six_eq_mRep_div_betaEW` | `BridgeEquivalence` | ✅ | The literal `6` in the bridge exponent is `m_rep / β_EW` with `m_rep = 24`, `β_EW = 4`. |
| `OPH.BridgeEquivalence.mRep_eq_six_mul_betaEW` | `BridgeEquivalence` | ✅ | The literal `24` decomposes as `6 · β_EW`. |
| `OPH.BridgeEquivalence.bridge_equivalence_beta` | `BridgeEquivalence` | ✅ | General-β bridge: for `β > 0`, `P > 0`, `αU > 0`, `N > π`: `N = π·exp((m_rep/β)·π/(P·αU)) ↔ tickProjection αU N = β·P`. |
| `OPH.BridgeEquivalence.bridge_equivalence` | `BridgeEquivalence` | ✅ | Literal form: `N = π·exp(6π/(P·αU)) ↔ (24π)/(αU·log(N/π)) = 4·P`. |
| `OPH.BridgeEquivalence.bridge_equivalence_tick` | `BridgeEquivalence` | ✅ | Tick corollary at `β = 4` with `24 = 6·β` carried as an explicit hypothesis. |
| `OPH.CapacityFixedPoint.averagingMap_isFixedPt_iff` | `CapacityFixedPoint` | ✅ | For `λ ≠ 0`, `x` is a fixed point of `(1−λ)·x + λ·K` iff `x = K`. |
| `OPH.CapacityFixedPoint.averagingMap_unique_fixedPt` | `CapacityFixedPoint` | ✅ | For `0 < λ ≤ 1` the averaging map has exactly one fixed point, `K`. |
| `OPH.CapacityFixedPoint.banach_unique_fixedPt` | `CapacityFixedPoint` | ✅ | `ContractingWith` map on a nonempty complete metric space has exactly one fixed point; wraps Mathlib `ContractingWith.fixedPoint`. |
| `OPH.CapacityFixedPoint.capacity_Icc_unique_fixedPt` | `CapacityFixedPoint` | ✅ | Lipschitz self-map of `Icc a b` with constant `K < 1` has exactly one fixed point in `Icc a b` (interval form used by the capacity certificates). |
| `OPH.SeedPi.capReadback_log_coords` | `SeedPi` | ✅ | In log coordinates `y = log(N/π)` the CAP-P readback `π·(N/π)^s` is the linear map `y ↦ s·y`. |
| `OPH.SeedPi.capReadback_log_coords_averaging` | `SeedPi` | ✅ | The log-coordinate readback equals `averagingMap (1−s) 0`, tying CAP-P to the uniqueness schema. |
| `OPH.SeedPi.capReadback_fixedPt_iff` | `SeedPi` | ✅ | CAP-P seed: for `s ≠ 1`, `N > 0`: `π·(N/π)^s = N ↔ N = π` (map shape from `F_candidate_capP.py`). |
| `OPH.SeedPi.linear_branch_no_positive_fixedPt` | `SeedPi` | ✅ | Additive CAP-P branches `F(N) = s·N`, `s < 1`, have no positive fixed point. |

## #304: Generic theorem and concrete bridge

The standalone proof package at `Proofs/ObservableNormalForms/` proves the
exact substrate-neutral equivalence

```text
boundary identification on consistent states modulo E
  ↔ cross-source normal-endpoint uniqueness modulo E.
```

`OPH.boundaryIdentifiesModulo_iff_observerEndpointUniqueModuloLR` in
`Source/ObserverPatchHolography/Bridges/ObservableNormalForms.lean`
machine-checks that Jonathan's H1--H3 completeness theorem and boundary
preservation instantiate that equivalence for `acceptedStepLR`.

This completes the generic observer-confluence interface but does not close
the live application obligation.  Closure still requires a declared physical
boundary map `B` and a proof that any two concrete consistent records with the
same `B` value are `gaugeEquiv`.

## Gap analysis: skeleton → theorem-grade Prop 4.2

(Revised per math-seat audit 2026-05-19.)

| Skeleton has | Prop 4.2 needs | Paper anchor |
|---|---|---|
| `r : X → X → Prop` (opaque) | `Repair` operating on `Records`, inducing rewriting on `World` representatives | lines 30, 297 |
| `X` (opaque) | `Records` carrier type (TeX macro, structural content per OPHConsensus) | lines 28, 1615 |
| `IsNormalForm` (opaque) | `NF` as terminal state of accepted repair built from local recovery moves, with local steps executed under asynchronous schedules in OPHConsensus | line 297; OPHConsensus §3 |
| `Φ : X → NNReal` (opaque) | Concrete `Φ(x) = Σ_e w_e · d_e(π_{i,e}(x_i), π_{j,e}(x_j))` on patch-overlap data | line 300 |
| (none) | `∼_gauge` is an equivalence relation | line 311 |
| (none) | **`∼_gauge` is a `Repair`-congruence**; descent to the physical quotient depends on this | line 327 ("on the physical quotient") |
| (none) | Quotient construction `World = NF(x) / ∼_gauge` | lines 305–313 |
| `Terminating r` (assumption) | OPH Lyapunov descent plus finite patch-net/value-set control gives termination of `acceptedStep`; repair completeness is a separate normal-form/consistency condition | OPHConsensus Prop. `lyapunov-termination`, Assumption `complete` |
| `LocallyConfluent r` (assumption) | OPH `Confluence` predicate (structurally defined per OPHConsensus) implies local confluence on patch repairs | line 326 |
| Confluence on `r` | Confluence stated **directly on the physical quotient**, not lifted from below. Prop 4.2 sentence 2 imposes conditions on the quotient. | lines 326–327 |

Closing each row of this table is the work that takes the skeleton to a
theorem-grade Prop 4.2 statement. Several rows depend on the companion
paper *Reality as a Consensus Protocol* (OPHConsensus); the target is
paper-incomplete as well as Lean-incomplete.

## Update protocol

When adding a Lean statement that targets a paper item:

1. Add a row in the appropriate section above.
