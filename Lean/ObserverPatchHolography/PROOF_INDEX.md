# Proof-to-Paper Index

Mapping between Lean 4 theorems in this project and statements in
*Paradise as Fixed-Point Consensus* (B. Müller, 2026; source in
`paper/paradise_as_fixed_point_consensus.tex`).

## Completion summary

- **Proposition 4.2 (theorem-grade): 0 / 9 obligation families formalised → 0%**
  (2 Prop-4.2 statements + Lyapunov termination/descent +
  OPH confluence + repair completeness + `repair_respects_gauge`
  quotient descent + `gaugeEquiv_equivalence` + `Φ`-formula match +
  quotient/NF construction)
- **Definition 4.1 (Public world): 0 / 11 Lean items built → 0%**
  (3 carrier types + repair-site/local-step package + 1 global repair +
  1 potential + 1 gauge relation + equivalence proof + congruence proof +
  2 quotient/NF construction items)
- Abstract-rewriting skeleton (preliminary): 5 / 5 proofs → 100%
- OPH primitives (declared, sorry-bearing): 0 / 10 discharged → 0%
- #304 boundary-fiber carrier witness (`Rule90.lean`, PR #385): 5 / 5 theorems, sorry-free → 100%
  (first non-degenerate `Hfib` discharge on a linear information-set carrier +
  `H1`–`H3` local-repair no-go; a carrier-level witness only. It does **not** bear
  on the Prop 4.2 / Def 4.1 counts above, which remain 0%)

The headline number is **0% of Proposition 4.2** until the OPH-specific
structures are in place. The 100% skeleton number is preliminary
infrastructure, not progress on Prop 4.2 itself. Counts revised per
math-seat audit (2026-05-19): previous "3+2" undercounted by ≈3×.

> **Addendum (2026-07-11) — the three declared `Primitives.lean` admissions
> are discharged.** `localRepair` is now a constructed single-site
> transactional recovery move (fires iff an incident overlap is broken and
> the site can satisfy all its overlaps at once, repaired state chosen from
> declared overlap data), `Repair` is a choice-canonical asynchronous
> schedule composed to a normal form (well-founded by broken-edge count),
> and `repair_respects_gauge` (Prop 4.2 sentence 2 congruence) is a proven
> theorem, all pinned at `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`. The
> file's own `LyapunovDescent` and `Termination` obligations are also
> discharged for the constructed operator (`lyapunovDescent_holds`,
> `termination_holds`), with normal-form/reachability receipts
> (`Repair_normalForm`, `Repair_reachable`). NOT discharged: OPH
> `Confluence` (false in general — `demoCarrier_not_confluent`),
> `Completeness` for the constructed operator (holds exactly on
> frustration-free dynamics via the conditional `H1`–`H3` layer), and the
> `NF`/`World` quotient construction. The tables and counts below predate
> this discharge and need a math-seat re-audit before renumbering; rows for
> `OPH.Repair`/`OPH.localRepair`/`OPH.repair_respects_gauge` should now read
> as constructed/proven rather than ⬜-declared.

## Status legend

- ✅  proven, sorry-free, matches paper statement
- 🟡  proven but generic (does not yet refer to OPH structure)
- 🔸  motivational only (no formal anchor in paper)
- ⬜  declared as `sorry` or thin placeholder / not yet formalised
- ❌  stated, contains unintended `sorry` or `admit`

## Definition 4.1: Public world

> `World = NF(x) / ∼_gauge`, where `NF(x)` is the terminal state reached by
> accepted repair and `∼_gauge` identifies hidden local presentations with
> the same declared observable overlap data.

## Abstract-rewriting skeleton (preliminary)

Generic results over `r : X → X → Prop` and `T : X → X`. Verified
sorry-free. These are the abstract layer the OPH
proof instantiates after the concrete repair layer is supplied.

| Lean name | Module | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `OPH.AbstractRewriting.newman_lemma` | `AbstractRewriting` | 🟡 | Terminating + locally confluent → confluent. Generic. |
| `OPH.AbstractRewriting.unique_normal_form` | `AbstractRewriting` | 🟡 | Confluent → unique normal forms. |
| `OPH.AbstractRewriting.newman_unique_nf` | `AbstractRewriting` | 🟡 | Combined: terminating + locally confluent → unique normal forms. |
| `OPH.AbstractRewriting.deterministic_full` | `AbstractRewriting` | 🟡 | Deterministic op with descent potential → unique fixed-point reached. |
| `OPH.AbstractRewriting.fixedPt_zero_potential` | `AbstractRewriting` | 🔸 | Any fixed point of a repair op has `Φ = 0`. **No paper anchor**: the passage at lines 330-334 is prose, not a labelled corollary; paper makes no formal `Φ(W) = 0` claim. Kept as preliminary ARS decoration only. |

## #304: Boundary-fiber observer uniqueness: Rule 90 carrier witness

> `Hfib`: within a fixed boundary fiber, consistent states are a gauge-singleton
> the hypothesis binder of `boundary_fiber_observer_unique` (`Primitives.lean`).

Instantiated on a linear (Rule 90) two-patch carrier, the first case where the
`#304` `Hfib` binder is non-degenerate (a proper, failable information set + a
non-trivial gauge), unlike `demoCarrier`'s seed tautology. A carrier-level
witness, **not** a Prop 4.2 / Def 4.1 item. Module:
`Source/ObserverPatchHolography/Rule90.lean` (PR #385). Sorry-free, standard axioms
only (`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`; no `native_decide`).

| Lean name | Module | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `OPH.rule90_Hfib_good` | `Rule90` | ✅ | Reading bottom cells {0,1} discharges `Hfib` on the consistent set, instantiating the `boundary_fiber_observer_unique` binder. |
| `OPH.rule90_Hfib_bad_fails` | `Rule90` | ✅ | Reading {0,2} fails: same carrier, coarser boundary. `Hfib` is about *which* cells `B` reads, not how many. |
| `OPH.rule90_gauge_nontrivial` | `Rule90` | ✅ | Seeds (0,0,0), (1,0,1) observably identical: the gauge contains `ker(Rule90)` (kernel-pair exhibit). |
| `OPH.rule90_no_frustrationFree_repair` | `Rule90` | ✅ | No `H1`–`H3` local repair exists on this carrier. Scope: transactional/multi-patch repair and relaxed `H2` are **not** ruled out. |
| `OPH.rule90t_outer_eq` | `Rule90` | ✅ | Helper: every Rule 90 image has equal outer cells. |

## #304: Generic theorem and concrete bridge

The standalone proof package at `Proofs/ObservableNormalForms/` proves the
exact substrate-neutral equivalence

```text
boundary identification on consistent states modulo E
  ↔ cross-source normal-endpoint uniqueness modulo E.
```

`OPH.boundaryIdentifiesModulo_iff_observerEndpointUniqueModuloLR` in
`Source/ObserverPatchHolography/Bridges/ObservableNormalForms.lean`
machine-checks that Jonathan's H1--H3 completeness theorem and boundary
preservation instantiate that equivalence for `acceptedStepLR`.

This completes the generic observer-confluence interface but does not close
the live application obligation.  Closure still requires a declared physical
boundary map `B` and a proof that any two concrete consistent records with the
same `B` value are `gaugeEquiv`.

## Gap analysis: skeleton → theorem-grade Prop 4.2

(Revised per math-seat audit 2026-05-19.)

| Skeleton has | Prop 4.2 needs | Paper anchor |
|---|---|---|
| `r : X → X → Prop` (opaque) | `Repair` operating on `Records`, inducing rewriting on `World` representatives | lines 30, 297 |
| `X` (opaque) | `Records` carrier type (TeX macro, structural content per OPHConsensus) | lines 28, 1615 |
| `IsNormalForm` (opaque) | `NF` as terminal state of accepted repair built from local recovery moves, with local steps executed under asynchronous schedules in OPHConsensus | line 297; OPHConsensus §3 |
| `Φ : X → NNReal` (opaque) | Concrete `Φ(x) = Σ_e w_e · d_e(π_{i,e}(x_i), π_{j,e}(x_j))` on patch-overlap data | line 300 |
| (none) | `∼_gauge` is an equivalence relation | line 311 |
| (none) | **`∼_gauge` is a `Repair`-congruence**; descent to the physical quotient depends on this | line 327 ("on the physical quotient") |
| (none) | Quotient construction `World = NF(x) / ∼_gauge` | lines 305–313 |
| `Terminating r` (assumption) | OPH Lyapunov descent plus finite patch-net/value-set control gives termination of `acceptedStep`; repair completeness is a separate normal-form/consistency condition | OPHConsensus Prop. `lyapunov-termination`, Assumption `complete` |
| `LocallyConfluent r` (assumption) | OPH `Confluence` predicate (structurally defined per OPHConsensus) implies local confluence on patch repairs | line 326 |
| Confluence on `r` | Confluence stated **directly on the physical quotient**, not lifted from below. Prop 4.2 sentence 2 imposes conditions on the quotient. | lines 326–327 |

Closing each row of this table is the work that takes the skeleton to a
theorem-grade Prop 4.2 statement. Several rows depend on the companion
paper *Reality as a Consensus Protocol* (OPHConsensus); the target is
paper-incomplete as well as Lean-incomplete.

## Update protocol

When adding a Lean statement that targets a paper item:

1. Add a row in the appropriate section above.
2. Cite the paper line range (use
   `paper/paradise_as_fixed_point_consensus.tex` line numbers).
3. Set status (✅ / 🟡 / 🔸 / ⬜ / ❌).
4. Update the completion summary.
5. Tag the PR with the affected proposition/definition for the cross-audit
   pass (Dula via Grok, Ben via ChatGPT-Pro). Bernhard merges.
