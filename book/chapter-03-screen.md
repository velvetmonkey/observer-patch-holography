# Chapter 3: The Screen and the Sphere

## 3.1 The Volume Hint

The ordinary intuition says more space should hold more data.

A bigger hard drive stores more files. A bigger warehouse holds more boxes. A bigger brain should hold more memories. The amount of stuff you can fit into a container should scale with its volume.

This is the **intuitive picture**: information content scales with volume.

$$\text{Information} \propto V$$

If you have a box and you divide it in half, each half should hold half the information. If you double the size of a room, you should be able to fit twice as many things in it.

The symbol $V$ means volume. The proportionality sign says that, in this
ordinary intuition, information capacity should grow in direct proportion to
the amount of three-dimensional space available.

This seems so obvious that nobody questioned it for most of physics history.

And it's wrong.

The universe gave us a spectacular, unexpected hint that information does not
work this way at all. The hint came from the strangest objects in the cosmos:
black holes.

## 3.2 The Teacup Problem: The Hint

In 1972, a graduate student named Jacob Bekenstein walked into John Wheeler's office at Princeton with a simple thought experiment.

Imagine a cup of hot tea. The tea has entropy: it is hot and messy, with many
microscopic arrangements of molecules that produce the same macroscopic state.

Lower the cup into a black hole.

The tea crosses the event horizon and vanishes. No one outside can ever see it again. If the tea is gone, so is its entropy. The total entropy of the observable universe has decreased.

But wait. The Second Law of Thermodynamics says total entropy never decreases. The Second Law is the rule that makes time flow in a direction. It tells you why broken glasses don't unbreak, why scrambled eggs don't unscramble, why we remember the past but not the future.

If a black hole can erase entropy, the Second Law is wrong.

### Bekenstein's Bold Response

Bekenstein proposed that black holes must have entropy. When the tea falls in,
the entropy does not disappear. It shows up as an increase in the black hole's
own entropy.

But where could a black hole's entropy hide?

Black holes are supposed to be simple. In general relativity, a black hole is
fully described by just three numbers: its mass, its electric charge, and its
spin. Wheeler called this the "no-hair theorem": black holes have no
distinguishing features.

So where are the microstates? Where is the internal structure that entropy requires?

Bekenstein looked at the only thing that changes when you throw stuff in: the
size of the event horizon. He made an educated guess, constrained by
dimensional analysis and theoretical consistency: the entropy is proportional
to the **area** of the horizon:

$$S \propto A$$

The volume does not appear. The area does.

### Hawking Confirms It

Stephen Hawking was skeptical. He set out to prove Bekenstein wrong by showing black holes have no temperature.

He studied quantum fields near a black hole horizon. What he found shocked him.

The vacuum of quantum field theory seethes with virtual particle pairs that pop
into existence and annihilate. Near a horizon, one particle can fall in while
the other escapes. To a distant observer, the black hole emits radiation,
**Hawking radiation**.

Hawking calculated the temperature:

$$T_H = \frac{\hbar c^3}{8\pi G M k_B}$$

Once a black hole has temperature, it must have entropy. From thermodynamics, Hawking derived:

$$S_{BH} = \frac{A}{4 \ell_P^2}$$

where $\ell_P = \sqrt{\hbar G/c^3} \approx 1.6 \times 10^{-35}$ m is the Planck length.

The entropy of a black hole is proportional to its surface area, measured in Planck units.

In Hawking's temperature formula, $T_H$ is the black-hole temperature, $M$ is
the black-hole mass, $G$ is Newton's gravitational constant, $c$ is the speed
of light, $\hbar$ is Planck's constant divided by $2\pi$, and $k_B$ is
Boltzmann's constant. Larger black holes are colder because $M$ sits in the
denominator.

### The Surprising Conclusion

**The hint**: Information scales with area, not volume.

**The lesson**: The intuitive picture that information content scales with the
size of a container fails for gravitational capacity. Black-hole entropy and
related bounds push strongly toward a boundary-sensitive description.

**The first-principles reframing**: The 3D world we experience can be an emergent bulk reconstructed from boundary data.

## 3.3 Why Entropy Points to the Boundary

Entropy counts how many microscopic arrangements fit one macroscopic description. Chapter 4 develops that idea carefully. The screen chapter needs one narrower lesson.

For black holes, the entropy is set by horizon area:

$$S_{BH} = \frac{A}{4 \ell_P^2}.$$

That is the surprise. The natural counting measure for the most extreme gravitating objects is area, not volume. Once that is true, any observer-centered account of accessible information has to take boundaries seriously.

Bekenstein sharpened the point further. Pack enough energy into a region and the region becomes a black hole. The black hole then supplies the maximum entropy compatible with that size. Area becomes the natural ceiling for accessible information in gravitational settings.

## 3.4 From Area Scaling to Holography

This is the jump from thermodynamics to geometry.

If the largest possible entropy in a region is controlled by its boundary, a boundary-first description stops looking like a metaphor. It becomes the natural bookkeeping choice. The bulk may be the world we experience, but the independent data is organized more economically on the boundary.

This is the holographic idea in its simplest form. A two-dimensional surface can encode a three-dimensional description, just as a hologram stores depth information on a film.

Chapter 8 returns to holography in full. For the present chapter, the conclusion is simpler. The horizon is the right place to organize the data available to an observer.

## 3.5 Black Holes and Horizons

A horizon is the boundary of what one observer can ever check.

### The Event Horizon

A black hole is a region of spacetime rather than a physical object in the usual sense. The **event horizon** is the boundary of that region. Once you cross it, you cannot escape.

The Schwarzschild radius of a black hole of mass $M$ is:

$$R_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}$$

For the Sun, this is about 3 kilometers. For Earth, it's about 9 millimeters. Any mass compressed within its Schwarzschild radius becomes a black hole.

$R_s$ is the Schwarzschild radius. The formula says that the critical radius
grows linearly with mass $M$. Compress the same mass inside that radius and
the escape velocity at the boundary reaches light speed.

A horizon is a causal boundary. You could cross it without noticing anything special. Once you're inside, the geometry of spacetime is such that all paths, even light paths, lead inward.

Near a black hole, space is falling inward like a waterfall. The event horizon is where the water falls faster than you can swim.

### Other Horizons

Black holes are not the only source of horizons.

**Cosmological horizons**: The universe is expanding, and cosmology distinguishes the observable-universe scale from the future event horizon. Regions from which light cannot reach us make observer access finite.

**Acceleration horizons**: If you accelerate continuously, there is a region behind you from which light can never catch up. You have a **Rindler horizon**. This produces the **Unruh effect**: an accelerating observer perceives the vacuum as a warm bath of particles.

In each case, the horizon is a boundary that limits what the observer can access. It is the edge of their observable universe.

### Every Observer Has a Screen

Finite observer access naturally suggests an effective screen picture.

The word "screen" needs care. OPH does not mean that every observer owns a
separate physical sphere, and it does not require a literal ball with data
painted on its surface. In the idealized description there is a shared
observer-facing screen net, often drawn with the symmetric chart $S^2$. A finite
observer has access only to a bounded local cut of that net. The observer's
operational screen is that accessible cut, and a patch is the part of the cut
that supports records, comparisons, and repair.

For an observer in our universe, the accessible boundary can take several
forms. There is an observer-dependent cosmological horizon scale. Near a black
hole there is an event horizon. Under sustained acceleration there is a
Rindler horizon.

In the simplest symmetric situations, the relevant causal boundary is approximately spherical. The area of this sphere bounds the amount of information the observer can access.

This is a deep shift in perspective. Space is not a fixed container. Each observer's horizon is a fundamental interface with reality.

## 3.6 Why a Sphere?

In the symmetric cases used to motivate this construction, the screen is naturally modeled as (approximately) spherical. This choice follows from causal light-cone geometry in those cases.

Light travels at the same speed in all directions. If you stand at a point and wait, the light that can reach you from a time $t$ ago forms a sphere of radius $ct$ around you.

Your past light cone, the set of events that could have influenced you, has
spherical cross-sections. Your future light cone also has spherical
cross-sections.

In those symmetric light-cone constructions, the sphere is a consequence of the geometry of causality.

### The Cosmic Microwave Background

The cosmic microwave background (CMB) illustrates this beautifully.

In the standard FLRW reconstruction, the CMB is light from the era when the
cosmic plasma cooled enough for atoms to form and photons to travel freely.
This light appears as a sphere around us: the **last scattering surface**.

We're at the center of this sphere, but so is everyone else. Every observer in the universe sees themselves at the center of their own CMB sphere.

The CMB sphere is a useful cosmological proxy for thinking about an observer-centered screen picture. It is one especially vivid example of how observer-accessible information can be organized on an apparent 2D sky.

## 3.7 The Geometry of the 2-Sphere

The mathematical object describing the screen is the 2-sphere, $S^2$.

$$S^2 = \{(x, y, z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 : x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1\}$$

We can parameterize it with spherical coordinates $(\theta,\phi)$. The angle
$\theta$ runs from the North Pole to the South Pole, and $\phi$ runs around the
equator from $0$ to $2\pi$.

The metric is:

$$ds^2 = d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \, d\phi^2$$

$S^2$ means the two-dimensional surface of a unit sphere, not the solid ball
inside it. In OPH it is also a chart, not a hardware blueprint. The set
notation says: take all points $(x,y,z)$ in ordinary three-dimensional real
space whose distance from the origin is 1. The metric $ds^2$ then tells you how
to measure tiny distances along that curved surface. The real physical content
is the patch algebra, the local state, the records, and the overlap data carried
by that chart.

### Spherical Harmonics

Any function on the sphere can be expanded in **spherical harmonics**, $Y_\ell^m(\theta, \phi)$. These are the natural modes of vibration of the sphere.

The CMB temperature variations are analyzed by expanding in spherical
harmonics. The **power spectrum**, meaning how much power sits at each angular
scale $\ell$, records the hot dense side of the standard cosmological
reconstruction.

### Finite Resolution

If one adopts a smallest screen length scale as a finite-cutoff modeling assumption, then there is a maximum $\ell$:

$$\ell_{max} \sim \frac{R}{\ell_P}$$

The total number of independent modes is roughly $\ell_{max}^2 \sim R^2/\ell_P^2$-proportional to area in Planck units, in line with the area scaling suggested by Bekenstein-Hawking.

In such a finite-resolution screen model, our experience of a continuous world is an approximation and the screen description becomes effectively discretized.

## 3.8 Patches and Overlaps

You cannot see the whole screen net. Some parts are hidden by your horizon or by
instrumental limits, and some parts are simply not in your operational domain.
You only access a **patch**, a connected region $P_O\subset S^2$ in the
symmetric chart.

Another observer, at a different location or with different instruments,
accesses a different patch. Where patches overlap, observers can compare notes.

If the screen net is charted by $S^2$ and observer $i$ has access patch $P_i$,
then two observers can compare data on the overlap $P_i \cap P_j$. That overlap
is the seed of consistency. Observer $i$ sees the local algebra, state, and
records supported on $P_i$. What $i$ and $j$ can make public is the part of
those descriptions that agrees on $P_i \cap P_j$.

![Two observer patches on the S^2 screen share a lens-shaped overlap where their descriptions can be compared.](../assets/book_diagrams/s2-screen.svg){width=74%}

### A Concrete Example

Consider two astronomers on opposite sides of Earth. During the night, they see different parts of the sky. But some stars are visible to both-stars near the horizon for each observer.

These shared stars provide a link. The astronomers can calibrate by comparing their observations of the overlap region. Once they agree on the overlap, they can combine their observations into a consistent map of the whole sky.

### Coordinate Charts and Atlases

A sphere cannot be covered by a single smooth coordinate system. If you try to put latitude-longitude coordinates on a sphere, you run into problems at the poles.

Mathematicians handle this by using multiple overlapping coordinate charts, called an **atlas**. Each chart covers part of the sphere. Where charts overlap, there are transition functions that tell you how to convert coordinates.

This is analogous to our observer patches. Each observer has a local
description. Where observers overlap, they must agree on how to translate
between their descriptions. The atlas is the mathematical way to say what the
informal picture says physically: one shared net can be covered by many local
charts, and no finite chart has to contain the whole net.

Physics is the art of finding descriptions that work in many charts and have consistent translations between them.

## 3.9 What Is an Observer?

We've talked about "observers" and their "patches." But what exactly IS an observer in this model?

### Not External Watchers

In classical physics, observers are implicitly outside the system-disembodied measurers who don't affect what they measure. This won't work here. Observers must be part of the system they observe.

### Observers as Patterns in the Data

An observer is a special pattern in the horizon data. It has bounded access to
a finite patch of the screen. It carries stable records, internal
correlations that persist as memory. It also builds compressed models of its
environment, not raw data dumps.

### The Vortex Analogy

Think of observers as stable vortices in a fluid.

The fluid is the quantum state on the horizon: constantly evolving, highly correlated. A vortex is a pattern within the fluid. It persists over time. It has a definite location. It interacts with other patterns.

An observer is like that: a stable, self-reinforcing pattern within the data on the screen. The pattern has access to a local region (its patch), maintains internal structure (its records), and can interact with nearby patterns (other observers, measured systems).

### Movement and Time

Do observers "move around" on the sphere?

Not in a simple sense. Different patches represent different observers, or the same observer at different moments. "Movement" is actually a sequence of overlapping patches with consistent marginals.

What creates the sense of time? The internal structure of the quantum state provides a natural flow: the **modular flow** from quantum statistical mechanics. For a thermal state, modular flow generates time evolution, and the thermal time principle provides an important interpretive-organizational guide.

Here, "flow" only means an internal rule for ordering changes. Think of it
as the clock a subsystem inherits from its own state, not a clock imposed from
outside. Chapter 11 returns to this slowly and gives the physics behind the
phrase.

### Why This Matters

This definition of observers resolves several puzzles:

**No external reference frame**: Observers are internal to the system, so there's no need for an external "God's-eye view."

**Measurement is physical**: When an observer measures something, correlations form between subsystems within the horizon data and stable records are created. That record formation captures the main physical content behind textbook collapse language.

**Consistency follows from structure**: In the constructive screen picture, if
two observers are modeled as patterns in the same underlying state, their
reduced descriptions must agree on overlaps. The more general gluing problem is
subtler and is developed later.

### Reality from Computation

A concrete screen picture looks like this.

Imagine the screen chart as a **gauge-invariant quantum system** on the
2-sphere, something like a quantum cellular automaton but with important
structure. This is a regulator picture for the observer-facing data, not a
claim that the world is built as one smooth spherical shell. Triangulate the
chart into tiny cells. At each edge of the triangulation sits a
finite-dimensional quantum system (a qudit). At each vertex, a gauge constraint
(Gauss's law) restricts which configurations are physical. Not all states
survive; only those satisfying the constraint at every vertex.

In plainer language, a qudit is a small quantum register with finitely many
possible readouts, like a qubit with more than two options. A gauge constraint
is a local accounting rule: many internal descriptions may be allowed, but only
the combinations that leave the shared physical quantities unchanged count as
physical.

**Observer patches** are subsystems defined by boundary-gauge-invariant algebras. Each patch is like a computational thread, a connected region where an observer can ask questions and get answers. The algebra $\mathcal{A}(R)$ defines what that observer can measure: the operators that commute with the boundary gauge transformations.

**Overlap consistency** is built into this constructive picture. Where two patches intersect, they access the same gauge-invariant observables. Both observers are reading the same underlying data, just from different angles. The gauge redundancy at boundaries is what makes gluing non-trivial and gives rise to the "edge modes" that carry geometric information.

**The dynamics** comes from MaxEnt: among all states consistent with the constraints, nature selects the maximum entropy state. At fixed cutoff this is modeled by a Gibbs-like state $\rho \propto e^{-H}$, where $H$ is a sum of local terms. The macroscopic physics then emerges from that constrained equilibrium picture.

**The 4D bulk isn't on the sphere.** It emerges from the entanglement structure between patches. When you look around and see three-dimensional space, you're experiencing a compressed encoding of how your patch is entangled with others. In the constructions emphasized later, bulk distance is read from boundary entanglement structure.

*The patch federation does the work. The screen is the chart. Reality is what observer patches agree on.*

In this book I sometimes call the chart readout a **folded screen**. The phrase
has a narrow meaning. Local patches compare overlaps, repair mismatches, and
settle to a quotient normal form. The spherical screen chart displays that
settled state as caps, collars, cuts, edge sectors, and boundary records.
Folding is the screen-facing presentation of repair.

One concrete model is a finite quantum machine. The specialist literature gives
that family of pictures names such as quantum link models, but the image itself
has to be handled carefully. The sphere is a working chart for what an
observer-facing cut exposes. The physical picture is a federation of finite
patches with shared boundary data.

This chart does real work. Caps and collars on the sphere identify the local
questions an observer can ask. Overlaps between caps identify the data two
observers can compare. The conformal symmetries of the same sphere become the
Lorentz symmetries of the shared spacetime description in the smooth regime.
The finite patch federation supplies the machine underneath that chart.

### A Plausible Hardware Sketch

The hardware itself does not need center stage. The useful picture is the
architecture: a federation of finite patches with exposed overlap ports. Short
local links connect neighbors. Local rules keep records stable, move
correlations across the interfaces, and let nearby patches stay in sync.

That picture turns the screen from a metaphor into a regulator chart over a
finite patch machine. It can be rebuilt in miniature with ordinary qubits,
then used to study finite-resolution measurement, durable records,
restoration, and synchronization inside one bounded system.

## 3.10 Entanglement Creates Depth

The screen gives a boundary. Three-dimensional depth appears when entanglement
starts arranging the data into an interior.

When parts of a quantum state are strongly correlated, they behave as one connected structure. In holographic settings this relation becomes quantitative: boundary entanglement constrains bulk geometry. The Ryu-Takayanagi formula and related results make that statement precise in the regimes where they apply.

One lesson is enough here. Depth is read off from correlation structure.
Strongly linked regions count as nearby in the emergent bulk. Weakly linked
regions count as distant.

Chapter 9 develops this in detail. In the present chapter, entanglement does one job. It explains why a screen can support an interior world, not a flat catalog of data.

## 3.11 The Sphere Ladder

The screen notation can be read as a small ladder of logical roles.

$S^0$ is the first distinction, the seed of a readout. Something can be marked
as this, with silence as the alternative. $S^1$ is recurrence: a loop in which a record can
return to itself and be checked again. $S^2$ is the screen, the public archive
where finite observers expose overlap data. $S^3$ is the reconstructed bulk,
the three-dimensional habitat that observers experience when the screen data
and entanglement pattern close coherently.

This ladder is a teaching map, with the full particle taxonomy carried by the
later chapters. The photon belongs to the recovered electromagnetic branch, gluons to color gauge
transport, the graviton to emergent geometry and diffeomorphism structure,
$W$, $Z$, and $H$ to the electroweak and Higgs sectors, and hadrons to QCD
composites. The ladder explains how OPH moves from seed, to loop, to screen,
to bulk. The particle labels are fixed later by Lorentz symmetry, gauge
structure, and the branch equations.

## 3.12 The Reverse Engineering

The reverse-engineering trail is short. The intuitive picture says
information scales with volume and space is the container. The hint is that
black-hole entropy scales with area, with gravitational entropy bounds pushing
toward boundary-limited information. The lesson is that a boundary-first
description becomes the strongest candidate. In the symmetric constructions
used here, each observer has an effective horizon naturally charted by a
spherical screen. The finite patch data exposed through that chart is limited
by $S\leq A/(4\ell_P^2)$. Its entanglement patterns create the geometry of the
emergent three-dimensional bulk, and overlap consistency makes that bulk shared
and stable across observers.

The holographic principle enters as the strongest explanatory reading of the hints reviewed above, not as a philosophical preference.

## 3.13 Pixel Limits

The numbers are small enough to state directly.

The Planck length is $\ell_P \approx 1.6 \times 10^{-35}$ meters-about $10^{20}$ times smaller than a proton. The Planck area is $\ell_P^2 \approx 2.6 \times 10^{-70}$ m².

**The de Sitter horizon**: After the selected OPH scale bridge is expressed in SI units, the radius is $R_{dS} \approx 1.66 \times 10^{26}$ m. The bare radius-squared count is $N_{\text{patch}} \approx 1.05\times10^{122}$. The corresponding Gibbons-Hawking entropy capacity is $N_{\text{scr}} \approx 3.31\times10^{122}$ in natural units, or about $4.77\times10^{122}$ bits. Other cosmological horizon conventions stay in the band from $10^{122}$ to $10^{123}$.

This is a truly enormous number-but it is finite. The observable universe contains a finite amount of information.

**A solar-mass black hole**: Schwarzschild radius $R_s \approx 3$ km. Number of bits: $N \approx 10^{77}$.

This is huge, but much smaller than the observable universe. Yet it's far more than the entropy of the Sun as a normal star (about $10^{58}$). Collapse increases entropy because the horizon has vastly more microstates than ordinary matter.

In the finite-resolution screen picture used here, continuous space is an effective approximation. The screen description is the fundamental descriptive layer.

## 3.14 Where We Go Next

We have established four linked facts. Gravitational entropy bounds and
holographic arguments push away from naive volume counting and toward
horizon-sensitive information organization. In the symmetric light-cone
constructions used here, the effective screens are spherical as a consequence
of causality. The amount of information is finite and bounded by area.
Entanglement patterns on the screen create the emergent three-dimensional
geometry.

The screen described here is static. It encodes information. What makes things happen? What creates the arrow of time?

The answer involves entropy again, this time in dynamics. The Second Law says entropy increases. But why? And what does this have to do with the screen?

In the next chapter, we explore the edge of the screen, the boundary conditions that govern what can happen. Entropy growth appears as a geometric constraint built into the structure of horizons themselves, alongside its statistical reading.

Chapter 4 turns the screen from a storage surface into a thermodynamic one.
