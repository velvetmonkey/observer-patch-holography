# Chapter 15: Relativity from Modular Time

## 15.1 The Intuitive Picture: Absolute Time and Newtonian Gravity

The intuitive picture is the Newtonian one. Time is universal and flows the
same everywhere. Space is a three-dimensional stage. Gravity is a force acting
at a distance.

This picture is simple and matches everyday experience. When you and your friend synchronize watches, they stay synchronized. When you walk across a room, the room doesn't change shape. When an apple falls, it's being pulled by the Earth.

Newton made this precise. In his *Principia* of 1687, he wrote: "Absolute, true, and mathematical time, of itself, and from its own nature, flows equably without relation to anything external."

Space was similarly absolute. A container that exists whether or not anything is in it. Objects move through space; space itself is fixed and unchanging.

This worldview worked spectacularly well for two centuries. It predicted planetary orbits, tides, the motion of comets. It launched the Industrial Revolution and put humans on the Moon.

Physics says otherwise.

## 15.2 The Surprising Hint: Light Refuses to Behave

### Maxwell's Equations

In the 1860s, James Clerk Maxwell unified electricity and magnetism into a single theory. His equations predicted electromagnetic waves traveling at a specific speed:

$$c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_0 \mu_0}} \approx 3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$$

This was the speed of light. Maxwell had discovered that light is an electromagnetic wave.

$c$ is the speed of light in vacuum. $\epsilon_0$ is the electric permittivity
of free space, and $\mu_0$ is the magnetic permeability of free space. Maxwell
did not put light into the theory by hand. The wave speed fell out of the
electric and magnetic constants and matched the measured speed of light.

But there was a puzzle. Speed relative to what?

### The Aether principle

Physicists assumed light must propagate through a medium, just as sound propagates through air. They called this medium the "luminiferous aether." It filled all space and provided the reference frame in which Maxwell's equations held.

If the aether exists, the Earth should be moving through it. As the Earth orbits the Sun at 30 km/s, we should be able to detect an "aether wind." Light traveling into the wind should be slower than light traveling with it.

### The Michelson-Morley Experiment

In 1887, Albert Michelson and Edward Morley built the most sensitive optical instrument of its time. They split a light beam in two, sent the halves in perpendicular directions, reflected them back, and recombined them.

If the aether existed, light traveling parallel to Earth's motion would take a different time than light traveling perpendicular. The recombined beams would be out of phase. Interference fringes would shift as the apparatus rotated.

They found nothing. No shift. No aether wind.

The experiment was repeated with increasing precision for decades. The result never changed. The speed of light is the same in all directions. There is no aether.

### The Crisis

This was deeply problematic. Maxwell's equations predicted a specific speed for light. But speed relative to what, if not the aether?

Lorentz and FitzGerald proposed that objects physically contract in the direction of motion, exactly canceling the expected time difference. This "length contraction" principle saved the appearances but seemed ad hoc.

The crisis demanded resolution. It came from a patent clerk in Bern.

## 15.3 Einstein's Revolution

### The Two Postulates

In 1905, Albert Einstein published "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies."
He cut through the confusion with two simple demands. The laws of physics had
to be the same in all inertial frames, and light had to travel at the same
speed in vacuum regardless of the motion of source or observer.

The second postulate sounds impossible. If you're on a train moving at 100 km/h and throw a ball forward at 50 km/h, a stationary observer sees the ball moving at 150 km/h. Velocities add.

But light doesn't work that way. If you're on the train and shine a flashlight forward, both you and the stationary observer measure the light traveling at exactly c. Not c + 100 km/h. Just c.

### Time Must Give Way

Einstein realized that if the speed of light is constant for all observers, something else must change. That something is time itself.

Consider two events: a flash of light is emitted, and it hits a detector. The time between these events depends on the observer.

For an observer at rest relative to the apparatus, light travels a short distance. The time interval is t.

For an observer moving relative to the apparatus, the light travels a longer path (following the moving detector). But light speed is the same. So the time interval must be longer: t' > t.

Moving clocks run slow.

### The Lorentz Factor

The mathematics falls out elegantly. Define:

$$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$$

This is the Lorentz factor. For everyday speeds, gamma is essentially 1. For v = 0.9c, gamma = 2.3. As v approaches c, gamma goes to infinity.

Here $v$ is the relative speed between inertial observers. The ratio $v/c$
measures that speed as a fraction of light speed. The square root in the
denominator is why nothing with mass reaches $c$: as $v$ approaches $c$,
$\gamma$ grows without bound.

Time dilation:

$$\Delta t' = \gamma \Delta t$$

A moving clock ticks slower by the factor gamma.

Length contraction:

$$L' = \frac{L}{\gamma}$$

A moving object is contracted in the direction of motion by the factor gamma.

### The Relativity of Simultaneity

The deepest consequence is subtler. Events that are simultaneous in one frame are not simultaneous in another.

If a train car is struck by lightning at both ends simultaneously (in the train frame), a stationary observer sees the front strike first. If the strikes are simultaneous for the stationary observer, the train passenger sees the rear strike first.

There is no absolute present. Simultaneity is relative.

## 15.4 Spacetime: The New Geometry

### Minkowski's Insight

In 1908, Hermann Minkowski, Einstein's former mathematics professor, recast special relativity as geometry. At a lecture in Cologne, he declared:

"Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality."

Space and time are not separate. They are aspects of a single entity: spacetime.

### The Spacetime Interval

In ordinary geometry, the distance between two points is:

$$ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2$$

This is invariant under rotations. Different observers who rotate their axes will disagree about x, y, and z individually, but they'll agree on ds.

In spacetime, the invariant quantity is:

$$ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2$$

Note the minus sign. Time enters with the opposite sign from space. This is Lorentzian geometry, not Euclidean.

Different observers disagree about t and x individually. But they all agree on ds. The spacetime interval is the fundamental invariant.

### The Light Cone

When ds^2 = 0, we have:

$$c^2 dt^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2$$

This describes light rays. Light travels on the boundary of the light cone.

Events with ds^2 < 0 (more time separation than space separation) are "timelike separated." A massive particle can travel between them.

Events with ds^2 > 0 (more space separation than time separation) are "spacelike separated." Nothing can travel between them. They are causally disconnected.

The light cone is the same for all observers, so causality is preserved even
when simultaneity is not.

## 15.5 Evidence for Special Relativity

Special relativity is firmly established. It's one of the most precisely tested theories in physics.

### Muon Decay

Muons are unstable particles created when cosmic rays hit the atmosphere. Their mean lifetime is 2.2 microseconds. Traveling at nearly light speed, they should decay long before reaching the ground.

But they don't. Time dilation stretches their lifetime. From our perspective, the muons' clocks run slow, so they live long enough to reach detectors at sea level.

From the muons' perspective, length contraction shrinks the atmosphere. They don't live longer; they just have less distance to travel.

Both perspectives are consistent. Both give the same answer. Muons reach the ground.

### Particle Accelerators

At the Large Hadron Collider, protons are accelerated to 0.999999991c. Their Lorentz factor is about 7,500. Their total energy is increased by the same factor relative to their rest energy.

If special relativity were wrong, the accelerator wouldn't work. The particles would behave differently than predicted. They don't. Special relativity is confirmed every second the LHC operates.

### GPS Satellites

The Global Positioning System requires timing accuracy of nanoseconds. GPS satellites orbit at high speed (time dilation makes their clocks run slow) and at high altitude (gravitational time dilation, which we'll discuss shortly, makes their clocks run fast).

Without relativistic corrections, GPS would accumulate errors of 10 kilometers per day. It works because the corrections are applied. Every time you use GPS, you're confirming Einstein.

## 15.6 General Relativity: Gravity as Geometry

Special relativity describes uniform motion. But what about acceleration? What about gravity?

### The Equivalence Principle

Einstein's breakthrough came from a simple observation. In a falling elevator,
you float weightless. You cannot tell the difference between falling in a
gravitational field and floating in empty space.

Conversely, standing on Earth feels exactly like accelerating upward at 9.8 m/s^2. You can't tell the difference.

This is the **Equivalence Principle**: gravity and acceleration are locally indistinguishable.

Einstein called this "the happiest thought of my life."

### The Elevator Thought Experiment

Imagine you're in a windowless elevator. It is sitting on Earth, or it is accelerating upward in empty space. How would you tell the difference?

You drop a ball. It falls. Is it being pulled by gravity, or is the floor accelerating up to meet it?

You can't tell. The two situations are physically equivalent.

Imagine a beam of light crossing the elevator horizontally. If the elevator is accelerating upward, the light's path curves downward relative to the floor. The light "falls."

By the equivalence principle, light must also bend in a gravitational field. Gravity affects light.

### Curved Spacetime

But wait. Light travels in straight lines. If light bends near massive objects, maybe "straight" isn't what we think.

Einstein's radical proposal: massive objects curve spacetime itself. Light travels along the straightest possible paths. But in curved spacetime, the straightest paths are curves.

A geodesic is the straightest path in a curved geometry. On a sphere, geodesics are great circles. On Earth, the shortest flight from New York to London curves north over the Atlantic.

In curved spacetime, planets don't orbit the Sun because of a force. They're following geodesics in the curved geometry created by the Sun's mass. They're going as straight as they can, but the space around them is bent.

### The Einstein Field Equations

Einstein spent years developing the mathematics. The result, published in 1915:

$$G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}$$

On the left: the Einstein tensor G, which describes the curvature of spacetime, plus a cosmological constant term.

On the right: the stress-energy tensor T, which describes the distribution of matter and energy.

The indices $\mu$ and $\nu$ label spacetime directions. $g_{\mu\nu}$ is the
metric, the object that tells spacetime how to measure intervals. $G_{\mu\nu}$
is built from the curvature of that metric. $\Lambda$ is the cosmological
constant. $T_{\mu\nu}$ is the stress-energy tensor. The coefficient
$8\pi G/c^4$ sets the strength of gravity in ordinary units.

John Wheeler summarized it: "Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve."

### Gravitational Time Dilation

Clocks run slower in stronger gravitational fields. This is gravitational time dilation.

At sea level, clocks tick slightly slower than at mountain tops. The effect is tiny but measurable. GPS satellites must correct for it.

Near a black hole, the effect is extreme. From far away, a clock falling toward the event horizon appears to slow down and freeze. The clock never seems to cross the horizon.

From the clock's perspective, nothing special happens at the horizon. It falls right through. But signals it sends take longer and longer to escape, until they can't escape at all.

## 15.7 Evidence for General Relativity

### The Precession of Mercury

Mercury's orbit precesses: its closest approach to the Sun slowly rotates around the Sun. Newton's theory couldn't fully explain this. There was a discrepancy of 43 arcseconds per century.

Einstein's equations predicted exactly this amount. It was the first confirmation of general relativity.

### Light Bending

Einstein predicted that starlight passing near the Sun would be deflected by 1.75 arcseconds. In 1919, Arthur Eddington photographed stars during a solar eclipse. The stars near the Sun appeared displaced.

The 1919 result was historically decisive, and later measurements confirmed the effect far more precisely. Headlines proclaimed: "Revolution in Science. New Theory of the Universe. Newton's Ideas Overthrown."

### Gravitational Waves

In 2015, the LIGO detectors observed gravitational waves for the first time. Two black holes, each about 30 solar masses, spiraled together and merged. The resulting gravitational waves stretched and compressed space itself.

The signal matched Einstein's predictions within the measured uncertainties. A
century after he wrote down the equations, ripples in spacetime were detected.

### Black Holes

General relativity predicts that sufficient mass concentrated in a small enough region creates a black hole: a region from which nothing, not even light, can escape.

In 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope photographed the shadow of the black hole at the center of galaxy M87. In 2022, they imaged Sagittarius A*, the black hole at the center of our own galaxy.

Black holes exist, and the observed strong-field data match general relativity extremely well in tested regimes.

## 15.8 Recovering Special Relativity from the Screen

The OPH connection is direct.

### Time as Modular Flow

In previous chapters, we developed the idea that time emerges from modular
flow. At finite cutoff, or in a special type-I representation, an observer has
a patch \(P\) on the holographic screen and the reduced density matrix on that
patch defines a modular Hamiltonian:

$$K_P = -\ln \rho_P$$

This Hamiltonian generates a flow:

$$\sigma_t(A) = e^{iKt} A e^{-iKt}$$

This modular flow provides the observer's natural notion of time on that patch.
Here $A$ is any observable the patch can ask about. The formula says how that
question changes as the patch's internal clock advances.

$\rho_P$ is the reduced density matrix for patch $P$. The logarithm turns the
state into its modular Hamiltonian $K_P$. The map $\sigma_t$ is the modular
time evolution, and $t$ is the modular time parameter. The exponentials are the
operator version of changing a question by flowing it forward and then back
through the patch's internal clock.

In the continuum limit this operator formula is not always the right target.
Continuum algebras can be non-type-I, so there may be no density matrix inside
the cap algebra and no inner operator \(K=-\log\rho\). The more general OPH
statement is about the modular automorphism group itself: the whole flow of the
cap's observable algebra, read on the geometric cap pair.

### Geometric Modular Flow on Caps

Consider a cap $C$ on the sphere $S^2$. In the smooth regime, the cap's
thermal time stops feeling like abstract algebra and starts behaving like an
actual motion on the sphere. This is where the construction turns into
relativity. A clock becomes a geometric device inside the math. Its flow becomes the
same kind of geometric motion that later shows up as boosts and time
translations.

In the controlled scaling construction, the modular flow of the extracted cap
pair matches a conformal motion of the sphere:

$$\sigma_t^{\omega_C} = \alpha_{\lambda_C(2\pi t)}$$

The left side is the algebraic clock: how the cap's allowed questions flow
under the state \(\omega_C\). The right side is a geometric motion of the
sphere. The function \(\lambda_C\) says how much cap dilation corresponds to
the modular-time parameter, and the \(2\pi\) fixes the thermal normalization.
The equality says that the algebraic clock and the geometric motion act the
same way on the cap observables.

This is a conditional statement. The cap pair has to be extracted cleanly, the
modular flow has to be transported through the regularized construction, the
round caps have to be rigid, and the KMS/Bisognano-Wichmann normalization has
to fix the \(2\pi\). Under those conditions, the algebraic flow and the
geometric cap dilation are the same operation. Finite cells by themselves do
not make Lorentz invariance. The geometric statement appears only after the
finite regulator is carried through the continuum comparison with controlled
state errors and a declared cutoff schedule.

That is the bridge. The clock defined by the state becomes the same clock
spacetime symmetry was looking for.

![Modular flow on a cap acts like an internal clock whose smooth limit becomes geometric motion on the screen.](../assets/book_diagrams/modular-flow-cap.svg){width=78%}

### Conformal Symmetry Is Lorentz Symmetry

The mathematical fact is that the group of orientation-preserving conformal
transformations of $S^2$ is

$$\text{Conf}^+(S^2) \cong PSL(2, \mathbb{C}) \cong SO^+(3,1)$$

The conformal group of the sphere is isomorphic to the Lorentz group.

This is the main reason the sphere is the right observer-facing chart. It gives
each observer a celestial sky, it gives local caps whose modular clocks can
become geometric flows, and it gives the exact symmetry group that relativity
uses to compare inertial observers.

$\text{Conf}^+(S^2)$ is the orientation-preserving conformal group of the
two-sphere. $PSL(2,\mathbb C)$ is the projective special linear group acting
by Moebius transformations. $SO^+(3,1)$ is the proper orthochronous Lorentz
group, the part of the Lorentz group connected to ordinary rotations and
boosts. The symbol $\cong$ means "is isomorphic to": the groups have the same
structure even though they are written in different languages.

Moebius transformations of the complex plane (which is the Riemann sphere S^2) are exactly Lorentz transformations of the celestial sphere that a relativistic observer sees.

A conformal transformation preserves angles while allowing local scale to
change. The Lorentz group preserves the light-cone structure of spacetime. The
isomorphism says these are the same symmetry written in two languages: angle
preservation on the celestial sphere and relativistic frame changes in
spacetime.

Lorentz kinematics is recovered when the observer-facing cap net reaches the
controlled geometric scaling branch, the cap modular automorphism acts as
a real geometric motion, and the rigidity hypotheses identify that motion with
the conformal action.

The same step fixes the number of spatial directions in the observer-facing
chart. A rest observer is represented by a future timelike direction. The
Lorentz group can move that direction, while ordinary rotations leave it
fixed. The spatial chart is therefore the quotient

$$H^3 = SO^+(3,1)/SO(3)$$

The Lorentz group has six generators. Rotations use three of them. The quotient
leaves three boost directions, so the spatial chart has dimension $6-3=3$.
This is why the recovered observer-facing bulk chart is three-dimensional.

### Why There Is No Privileged Reference Frame

This deserves careful explanation, because it addresses a natural worry about OPH.

If reality is encoded with a screen chart carrying finite local degrees of
freedom, why isn't there a "God's eye view" of the whole chart? Wouldn't that be
a privileged reference frame?

The answer is that **there is no observer outside the screen net**. The sphere
serves as the symmetric chart for observer-facing support data, with no
external inspection platform above it. OPH does not include any
external vantage point. Observers have no user seat outside the computation.
They are patterns *within* the screen data itself.

Think about what an observer actually is in OPH. An observer is a stable
correlation pattern among some subset of the screen degrees of freedom. This
pattern has access only to its patch $P_O \subset S^2$. No observer can access
the entire screen net simultaneously. The "global state" $\omega$ exists
mathematically, but no entity within OPH can observe it as a private object.

Consider two observers with overlapping patches. Each has a modular flow, a
local clock. When their descriptions are compared, the admissible
transformations have to map patches to patches, preserve the overlap
structure, and avoid turning any one patch into the privileged center of the
world. A natural symmetry group that does that is the conformal group of
$S^2$, and $\text{Conf}(S^2)\cong \mathrm{SO}(3,1)$ is the Lorentz group.

So Lorentz invariance appears as the natural symmetry class relating observer perspectives without privileging any one of them.

**The screen degrees of freedom do not need to move.** What we call "motion" in
the emergent 4D spacetime is not the substrate rearranging itself inside a
pre-given bulk. Motion is a pattern in how correlations change. A "moving
particle" is a correlation pattern that shifts across the screen. A "Lorentz
boost" is a transformation relating how two observers describe the same
correlation pattern.

The substrate is not in spacetime. Spacetime emerges from how patches relate to
each other. Asking "what frame is the substrate in?" is like asking "what color
is the number seven?" The question assumes a category error.

### Why the Speed of Light Is Universal

Why is there a maximum speed, and why is it the same for everyone?

On the recovered geometric branch, the common causal structure on the screen
determines the effective light cone.

The speed of light $c$ is then the conversion factor between modular time and
geometric distance in the emergent bulk description. It is universal because
all observers read the same conformal light-cone structure.

Different observers have different modular flows. On the geometric branch, the
inter-observer relations are carried by conformal transformations of $S^2$.
The Lorentz group is the corresponding symmetry of the shared causal structure.

The neutral-bulk evidence gate is weaker and separate. It can establish a common
quotient-visible pseudometric or metric on observer features after chart
transport, missingness, invariance, refinement, and held-out controls. A
positive metric by itself is not Lorentzian spacetime. The relativity claim
needs causal order, time separation, and the modular/geometric branch that
identifies the shared light-cone structure.

## 15.9 Recovering General Relativity

Special relativity emerges from the conformal structure of the screen. What about gravity?

### How Patch Consistency Enters

Patch consistency does two jobs here. First, it forbids any preferred
observer or preferred frame. Second, once each observer gets the same local
rest-frame relation, patch consistency forces those local relations to fit
together into a tensor law. MaxEnt supplies the equilibrium state, modular
flow supplies the local clock, and the null-modular bridge plus the
bounded-interval kernel let generalized-entropy stationarity feed the Einstein
branch.

The finite consensus theorem has a narrower job. It supplies quotient normal
forms for visible records. The Einstein branch starts after those normal forms
are read as cap, diamond, stress, tetrad, and scale data on the five-axiom
recovered-core geometric branch. The compact paper states the bridge
explicitly: bare consensus alone does not supply geometry, modular flow, stress
readout, bounded-interval control, small-ball area response, or timelike
coverage. The recovered-core support-visible branch supplies those inputs.

### Jacobson's Insight (1995, 2016)

The thermodynamic route predates OPH. In 1995, Ted Jacobson showed that
Einstein's equations can be derived from thermodynamics. Horizon entropy scales
with area, heat becomes energy flux across a horizon, and temperature scales
with surface gravity. Demand that the first law hold for every local horizon
and Einstein's equation appears as the geometry required by that bookkeeping.

### What OPH Adds

OPH provides the selection rule that makes entanglement equilibrium
natural. The global state maximizes entropy subject to overlap consistency
constraints. On the realized cap-label-preserving MaxEnt family, admissible
fixed-cap variations satisfy

$$\delta S_{\text{gen}}(C) = 0$$

Entropy is stationary because the chosen state sits at the maximum
allowed by the local consistency data.

The word admissible carries the load. The cap, boundary sector, charges, and
declared constraint values are held fixed, apart from the stress-energy
perturbation channel. Hidden carriers, port labels, gauge presentations, and
repair schedules are not extra variation knobs in this theorem.

**The first law:** For a small cap C with generalized entropy:

$$S_{\text{gen}}(C) = \frac{\langle A \rangle}{4G} + S_{\text{bulk}}(C)$$

The first law relates entropy variation to modular energy:

$$\delta S_C = \delta \langle K_C \rangle$$

$S_{\text{gen}}(C)$ is the generalized entropy associated with cap $C$.
$\langle A\rangle$ is the expected area term, $G$ is Newton's constant, and
$S_{\text{bulk}}(C)$ is the entropy of the bulk quantum fields assigned to the
cap. The symbol $\delta$ means a small allowed variation. The equality says
that a small entropy change matches a small modular-energy change.

Once the controlled BW construction has supplied the geometric modular
automorphism, the special type-I realization may be written as
$K_C = 2\pi B_C + \text{const}$. On that extra representation, the first law
becomes:

$$\delta S_C = 2\pi \delta \langle B_C \rangle$$

### The Stress Tensor Bridge

To get Einstein's equation, modular energy has to be connected to the stress
tensor. One route passes through a UV CFT regime, where the modular
Hamiltonian is explicitly local:

$$K = \int_\Sigma T_{ab} \zeta^b d\Sigma^a$$

where $\zeta$ is the conformal Killing field preserving the diamond.

The stress tensor is the local density and flow of energy and momentum. A
conformal Killing field is the infinitesimal motion that preserves the causal
diamond's conformal shape. This formula says the modular energy can be read as
ordinary local energy weighted by that geometric motion.

A second route works directly with null surfaces. A null surface is a
lightlike boundary, the kind followed by a light ray. On the OPH null bridge,
the renormalized half-line modular family fixes a positive null-translation
generator, and the same half-line derivative identifies that generator with
the local null-stress charge on that family. The same lightlike bridge then
feeds the bounded-interval kernel and tensor reconstruction used by the
framework.

![Near a cap boundary point, the curved screen geometry straightens into a null light ray.](../assets/book_diagrams/null-blowup.svg){width=82%}

### The Einstein Equation

Combining the entropy variation with the geometric identity for area variation
at fixed volume, one obtains the first-variation Einstein relation in the same
local $d=4$ scaling regime. In four dimensions the small-ball area variation
used by the compact paper is

$$\delta A|_{V,\Lambda} = -\frac{4\pi \ell^4}{15}\,
\delta\!\left[(G_{ab}+\Lambda g_{ab})u^a u^b\right]+o(\ell^4)$$

Here $\delta A|_{V,\Lambda}$ is the small change of area while the small
diamond's volume and the metric-term convention are held fixed. $\ell$ is the
diamond's characteristic size, $u^a$ is the local rest-frame four-velocity,
$G_{ab}$ is the Einstein tensor, $g_{ab}$ is the metric, and $\Lambda$ is the
cosmological-constant term. The formula says that the area response of the
local screen is controlled by the same curvature combination that appears in
Einstein's equation.

The equilibrium condition then compares that geometric response with the
matter-energy response:

$$\delta\!\left(G_{00} + \Lambda g_{00}\right) = 8\pi G\,\delta\langle T_{00} \rangle$$

This holds in the rest frame of each small cap for admissible first variations.
$T_{00}$ is the local energy density, the angle brackets mean expectation
value, and the factor $8\pi G$ is the Newton normalization on the selected
gravity branch.

### Where Patch Consistency Actually Enters

Here the distinctive OPH move enters. Different observers through the same
bulk point carry different rest frames. The equilibrium argument gives the
first-variation relation in each of those frames. The branch must cover all
local timelike directions and reference states. Under that condition, the
scalar relations fit one common tensor law. If observer A and observer B agree
on the overlap physics, their frame-dependent equations have to be shadows of
one frame-independent tensor relation:

$$G_{ab} + \Lambda g_{ab} = 8\pi G \langle T_{ab} \rangle$$

On the stated scaling branch, this is the semiclassical Einstein equation,
obtained by combining the thermodynamic argument, geometry readout, the
null-stress bridge, bounded-interval kernel, and the timelike
scalar-to-tensor upgrade. The local argument leaves the metric term open; the
capacity branch fixes it.

The word "branch" is important. Bare finite consensus by itself does not
contain a metric, a stress tensor, an area law, or an Einstein equation. Those
objects enter through the five-axiom recovered-core geometric-modular scaling
branch listed in the compact paper. The algebraic
upgrade after those inputs is tight: all timelike rest-frame relations give the
full tensor equation, and the local metric-term residue becomes one constant
Lambda only after the contracted Bianchi identity, local stress conservation,
metric compatibility, and connectedness are in place.

The lower-case indices $a,b$ again label spacetime directions. The angle
brackets around $T_{ab}$ mean expectation value: matter remains quantum, so
the geometry responds to the averaged stress-energy seen in the effective
state. This is why the equation is semiclassical. Geometry is classical in the
approximation, while matter retains quantum expectation values.

### The Derivation Chain

The chain is straightforward. MaxEnt selects the equilibrium state among
overlap-consistent configurations. Entanglement equilibrium gives the
thermodynamic relation in each local rest frame. Geometric modular flow turns
modular energy into physical energy. The stress-tensor bridge identifies the
energy content. Each observer reads the Einstein relation in their own frame,
and patch consistency forces those local readings into one tensor equation.

### Classical Mechanics from Emergent GR

Once the semiclassical Einstein relation is established, classical mechanics
follows in the same effective regime.

**Conservation laws.** The contracted Bianchi identity is geometric: $\nabla^a G_{ab} = 0$. Combined with the Einstein equation in the scaling regime, this implies stress-energy conservation: $\nabla^a T_{ab} = 0$. Energy and momentum are conserved because the geometry demands it.

**Geodesic motion.** For pressureless matter ("dust"), $T^{ab} = \rho u^a u^b$. Conservation gives $\nabla_a(\rho u^a u^b) = 0$. Working this out yields the geodesic equation: $u^a \nabla_a u^b = 0$. Free particles follow the straightest paths through curved spacetime. No additional postulate is needed. It follows from the Einstein equation in the same effective regime.

**Newton's laws.** In the weak-field, slow-motion limit, the Einstein equation reduces to Newton's gravitational law: $\nabla^2 \Phi = 4\pi G \rho$. Geodesic motion becomes $\ddot{\mathbf{x}} = -\nabla \Phi$. This is Newton's second law with gravitational force.

![Einstein's equation reduces to Poisson's equation, gravitational potential, and Newton's force law in the weak-field slow-motion limit.](../assets/book_diagrams/newton-limit.svg){width=82%}

So classical mechanics is a derived consequence. The familiar laws of motion and gravity emerge from the deeper framework when we consider the appropriate limit. Newton's physics remains valid in its domain and belongs to the effective level.

## 15.10 Why Emergent Gravity Works

If spacetime geometry emerges from information theory, why does general relativity work so well?

### The Hydrodynamic Limit

Think of water. At the microscopic level, it's a chaotic collection of molecules bouncing around. But at macroscopic scales, it flows smoothly. The Navier-Stokes equations describe this flow without reference to individual molecules.

Spacetime is similar. At the Planck scale, it is a quantum mess. But at macroscopic scales, the "molecules" average out. What remains is the smooth geometry of general relativity.

This is a hydrodynamic limit. The screen has an enormous number of degrees of freedom. Their collective behavior is captured by a smooth metric.

### Error Suppression

Corrections to general relativity scale as:

$$\left(\frac{\ell_P}{L}\right)^2$$

where L is the scale of interest and the Planck length is:

$$\ell_P = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^3}} \approx 10^{-35} \text{ m}$$

For any macroscopic process, this ratio is absurdly tiny. General relativity is extraordinarily accurate for all practical purposes.

### The Best Compression

Emergent geometry is the most economical description of how modular clocks fit together.

Imagine collecting all the data about how every patch's modular flow relates to every other patch's flow. This is an enormous amount of information.

But there's a compression. In the effective geometric regime, specifying a
metric $g_{ab}$ organizes the leading overlap relations between nearby modular
flows. The metric is the compressed description that captures that common
structure.

This compression comes after neutral reconstruction, which first gives
distances between features after redundant labels have been
identified. The geometry readout, modular bridge, fixed-cap stationarity,
small-ball area variation, and tensor-upgrade steps then upgrade the relevant
geometric data to spacetime dynamics.

General relativity is the natural effective dynamics associated with this compression. It is the simplest theory that respects the recovered structure.

## 15.11 What the Framework Resolves

These conventional physics questions have natural answers in OPH.

### The Planck Scale: Not a Mystery

In standard physics, people ask: "What happens at the Planck scale? Does spacetime break down?"

OPH dissolves this question. The holographic screen with its algebra net at UV scale ℓ_UV is the fundamental description. Spacetime geometry doesn't "break down" at small scales because spacetime was never fundamental. It emerges from the screen.

The Planck scale marks where the emergent geometric description becomes unreliable. Below this scale, you must use the screen description directly. There's no mysterious "quantum foam" or "spacetime fluctuations." There's just the algebra net, which is perfectly well-defined.

This is like asking "what happens to temperature below one molecule?" The question is malformed. Temperature is emergent. Below a certain scale, you switch to the microscopic description. The same applies to geometry.

### The Cosmological Constant: Not a Problem

The "cosmological constant problem" assumes quantum field theory is fundamental. QFT predicts vacuum energy 10^120 times larger than observed. Something must cancel it.

QFT is an effective description that emerges from the screen. The effective
cosmological constant is tied to the reference
curvature and global screen capacity discussed in Chapter 13 through
dimensionless products such as $\Lambda\ell_\star^2$. In natural units, the
Gibbons-Hawking entropy is $S = A/(4G)$. For the late-time de Sitter horizon,
after the OPH scale branch is expressed in SI units, this gives a bare
radius-squared ratio near $1.05\times10^{122}$ and an entropy capacity near
$3.31\times10^{122}$.

The "problem" exists only if you compute vacuum energy using QFT and assume
that calculation is fundamental. OPH fixes the dimensionless global-capacity
relation. The numerical SI value of Lambda also needs the selected scale that
connects the screen units to laboratory units, rather than a local QFT
vacuum-energy sum. QFT vacuum fluctuations are emergent phenomena, not
fundamental contributions to the stress tensor.

The observed small value of Lambda is therefore not a cancellation between
large local vacuum-energy terms. In OPH it belongs to the global
capacity-closure branch. The dimensionless closure fixes the de Sitter
capacity relation; the SI value also depends on the selected scale. The
fixed-point map must come directly from the finite observer grammar rather than
from tuning a QFT vacuum-energy sum.

### Black Hole Information: Screen Encoding and Recoverability

Fundamental data live on the screen, while the bulk, including black hole
interiors, is emergent.

That changes the bookkeeping. The boundary-sector structure blocks a naive factorization into independent inside and outside Hilbert spaces. The recovery measure from Chapter 7, small CMI, supports an interior-encoding statement: in the controlled regime, the interior partner is approximately recoverable from outside-plus-radiation data, not present as a separate fundamental tensor factor.

This is the sense in which OPH softens the information paradox. The fundamental store of information is the screen, not an autonomous bulk interior.

The important point is simpler. Information belongs to the screen bookkeeping,
and the interior is encoded, not stored in a second independent vault. Page
curves and islands show the same lesson in the cleanest holographic examples.

## 15.12 Dark Sector: The Modular Anomaly

### The Problem

Galaxies rotate too fast. The stars at the outer edges orbit the galactic center at speeds that should fling them into intergalactic space, given the visible matter. Something provides extra gravitational pull.

The standard response: dark matter particles. Some new, weakly interacting particle that clumps around galaxies and provides the missing mass. Decades of searches have produced no confirmed new particle.

An alternative: modify gravity (MOND). At low accelerations, perhaps gravity
behaves differently. This fits many galaxy rotation curves, but struggles with
galaxy clusters and the Bullet Cluster.

### A Third Route

OPH gives a third route. Extra gravitational pull can come from imperfect
information recovery rather than from a new particle species.

The underlying logic is simple. In the ideal Markov limit, information on one
side of a boundary is recoverable from the boundary itself, and the gravity
branch follows the Einstein relation on the declared geometric branch. Away from that ideal limit, some
correlation sits out of reach. That leftover correlation has physical weight in
the modular bookkeeping, so it can appear as an extra gravitational term.

This makes the dark sector a screen problem. Visible matter supplies the
baryonic pull. The residual recovery defect supplies another gravitational
contribution, dark to telescopes because it has no ordinary electromagnetic
handle.

### Why It's Dark

The sector is dark at the level of its couplings. It comes from information
structure, it gravitates, and it does not couple electromagnetically. Rotation
curves, lensing, clusters, and cosmology then become different views of the
same recovery term rather than separate excuses for invisible material. That is
the organizing claim; paper-grade promotion requires separate source,
abundance-selector, simulator, Boltzmann, and likelihood receipts.

### The MOND Scale

The cosmological constant supplies the natural infrared scale. The de Sitter
radius then singles out a characteristic acceleration:

$$a_0 = \frac{15}{8\pi^2} c^2 \sqrt{\frac{\Lambda}{3}} \approx 1.0 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m/s}^2$$

This lands near the empirical MOND acceleration scale. The proximity matters
because it ties galaxy-scale anomalies back to the same de Sitter capacity
logic that shaped the horizon from the start. Chapter 13 tells the longer
cosmological version: the galaxy-scale anomaly and the dark-energy horizon are
linked by the same infrared capacity scale. The galaxy law is the settled,
low-acceleration limit. Clusters, the CMB, and structure growth require the
transported stress version of the story, plus a source-only selector for the
homogeneous anomaly abundance.

## 15.13 Reverse Engineering Summary

The old picture treated time as universal, gravity as a force, and geometry as
a fixed stage. Relativity overturns each part. The speed of light forces time
and distance into one four-dimensional structure. Free fall reveals gravity as
geometry. OPH pushes the logic one step deeper. On the controlled scaling
branch, Lorentz symmetry becomes the geometry of how modular times mesh across
patches, the rest-space quotient gives three spatial directions, and gravity
becomes the fixed-cap equilibrium condition after the geometry readout,
null bridge, bounded-interval kernel, small-ball area identity, and tensor
upgrade have all been supplied.

On this reading, the speed of light is the conversion factor between
information flow on the screen and emergent geometry in the bulk. On the
Einstein branch, Einstein's equation is
the public face of entanglement equilibrium written in the language of
curvature.

Newton's absolute time and space were beautiful ideas that served humanity
well for two centuries. They were approximations. The deeper truth is that
time and space emerge from the physics itself.

This yields emergent spacetime with Lorentz kinematics and
the Einstein relation on the stated scaling branch. We have seen how both
spacetime and particles emerge from the screen. Chapter 16 turns to matter
inside that picture, and to the way classical notions of particle, energy, and
motion grow out of the deeper quantum structure.

That's the question of **Chapter 16: Matter, Motion, and Classical Physics**.
