# Chapter 13: The de Sitter Patch

## 13.1 The Intuitive Picture: The Universe Is Static or Decelerating

Start with the old cosmological picture.

The universe is either static, with things staying roughly as they are, or
decelerating, with gravity pulling everything together and slowing expansion.
This is the natural expectation from Newton through Einstein.

Einstein himself added a "cosmological constant" to his equations in 1917 to create a static universe, a universe that neither expanded nor contracted. When Hubble discovered the universe is expanding, Einstein dropped the constant, calling it his "greatest blunder."

Even after accepting expansion, the expectation was deceleration. Gravity
attracts. The mutual pull of all the matter in the universe should slow the
expansion, like a ball thrown upward gradually slowing. The expansion might
stop or even reverse.

Supernova data broke that picture.

## 13.2 The Surprising Hint: The Universe Is Accelerating

### The 1998 Supernova Observations

In January 1998, two teams of astronomers independently announced results that overturned our understanding of the cosmos.

Saul Perlmutter led the Supernova Cosmology Project. Brian Schmidt and Adam
Riess led the High-Z Supernova Search Team. Both groups had spent years hunting
Type Ia supernovae, the "standard candles" of cosmology.

Everyone expected to find that expansion is slowing. The data showed the opposite.

Distant supernovae were fainter than expected, farther away than a decelerating
universe would predict. The universe is **speeding up**.

Something is pushing the cosmos apart. Something is fighting gravity and winning. The teams called it "dark energy."

The supernova result also rested on historical work. Henrietta Leavitt's study of
Cepheid variable stars gave astronomy a way to climb the cosmic distance
ladder. Edwin Hubble's expansion law made the universe dynamical. Walter Baade,
Allan Sandage, Vera Rubin, Kent Ford, and many others sharpened the large-scale
picture long before the 1998 teams found acceleration. Cosmology is a relay
race. The de Sitter clue entered this book through a century of measurements,
calibrations, and arguments about what the sky was actually saying.

### The Cosmological Constant Returns

In the simplest late-time fit, a positive cosmological constant, Lambda greater
than zero, creates a repulsive large-scale tendency that grows with distance.
In the conventional late-time reconstruction, matter once dominated the
large-scale stress budget. As the effective expansion diluted matter, the
dark-energy component took over.

The standard fit places the transition to accelerated expansion about 5 billion
years back along our reconstructed branch and summarizes the cosmic budget as
about 68% dark energy.

If that component is a true cosmological constant, the future approaches a de
Sitter phase. The DESI-era data keep dynamical dark energy on the table, so this
chapter treats de Sitter as the standard branch used for the OPH capacity
calculation.

## 13.3 The First-Principles Reframing: De Sitter Is the Natural Screen

The deeper question is why late-time cosmology points toward a de Sitter patch.

### The Static Patch

What does one observer actually experience in de Sitter space?

As you look outward, galaxies recede faster and faster. At a critical distance $r_H = c/H$, the recession velocity equals the speed of light. Beyond this radius, light can never reach you.

Here $H$ is the Hubble expansion rate for the de Sitter phase. The formula says
that expansion itself creates a distance beyond which signals cannot overcome
the stretching of space.

This defines your **cosmological horizon**, the boundary of your causal access.

![A de Sitter static patch gives one observer a finite horizon screen whose capacity scales with area.](../assets/book_diagrams/desitter-static-patch.svg){width=78%}

Inside the horizon, you can use static coordinates. This region, the
**static patch**, is all of de Sitter space that you can ever access.

### De Sitter Fits OPH

**The de Sitter horizon is the natural holographic screen.**

The fit is tight. Observers have finite patches, and the static patch
is bounded by a horizon. The patch boundary is an $S^2$, exactly the geometry
the framework wants. The entropy is finite through the Gibbons-Hawking area
law. No observer sees beyond the horizon, so there is no God's-eye view.
Observer equivalence is built in because de Sitter is maximally symmetric.
Time is patch-dependent because there is no preferred global clock.

The static patch is the natural arena for physics from an observer's perspective.

## 13.4 The Gibbons-Hawking Temperature

In 1977, Gary Gibbons and Stephen Hawking proved that the cosmological horizon
radiates like a black body:

$$T_{dS} = \frac{\hbar H}{2\pi k_B}$$

For our universe, this is about 10^{-30} Kelvin, far below direct detection.
In conventional inflationary cosmology, horizon-scale quantum fluctuations are
stretched and later seed structure formation. OPH assigns that job to finite
observer-screen synchronization: screen geometry and source release supply
candidate large-scale coherence, and ordinary Boltzmann transfer carries finite
source data to the sky.

The symbols echo earlier horizon physics. $T_{dS}$ is the de Sitter
temperature. $\hbar$ is Planck's constant divided by $2\pi$. $H$ is the Hubble
rate for the de Sitter phase. $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant, which converts
energy units into temperature units. The denominator $2\pi$ is the same
circle factor that appears in Unruh and Hawking horizon temperatures.

Empty space is not glowing brightly around us. An observer confined to one
static patch sees the horizon as a thermal environment. Part of the quantum
state is inaccessible beyond the horizon, and that loss of access has the same
thermodynamic signature that horizons have elsewhere in gravitational physics.

### Why This Temperature? The Unruh Connection

The Gibbons-Hawking and Unruh formulas are closely related, but the identification has to be stated carefully.

A geodesic observer at the center of the static patch has zero proper acceleration, while a generic observer held at fixed radius has a radius-dependent proper acceleration. Near a horizon, the local de Sitter temperature reduces to the corresponding Unruh form:

$$T_U = \frac{\hbar a}{2\pi c k_B}$$

So the de Sitter and Unruh temperatures are locally linked, but they should not be identified by assigning every static-patch observer the same acceleration $a = cH$.

This has an important implication for OPH: **de Sitter horizons satisfy the same thermodynamic relations as Rindler horizons**. This is standard Gibbons-Hawking thermodynamics.

### Finite Entropy

If the horizon has temperature, it must have entropy:

$$S_{dS} = \frac{A}{4\ell_P^2} = \frac{\pi c^5}{G\hbar H^2}$$

This is the entropy associated with one de Sitter static patch, the logarithm
of the effective number of states accessible within that patch.

Here $A$ is the horizon area, $\ell_P$ is the Planck length, $c$ is the speed
of light, $G$ is Newton's gravitational constant, and $H$ again sets the
de Sitter expansion rate. The first expression is the area law. The second is
the same law after writing the horizon radius in terms of $H$.

For the late-time horizon of our universe, $R_{dS} \approx 1.66 \times 10^{26}$ m. The bare radius-squared count is

$$N_{\text{patch}} = \left(\frac{R_{dS}}{\ell_P}\right)^2 \approx 1.05 \times 10^{122}.$$

The entropy capacity includes the area factor:

$$N_{\text{scr}} = S_{dS} = \pi N_{\text{patch}} \approx 3.31 \times 10^{122},$$

or about $4.77 \times 10^{122}$ bits.

That is the practical meaning of the formula. It is a capacity statement. The patch does not contain an infinite amount of information hidden in a smooth continuum. It contains a finite number of distinguishable states, and the area of the horizon tells you how large that state space can be.

This finite entropy has major implications. An observer's accessible patch has a
finite information capacity. The smooth continuum starts to look like an
effective description laid over a screen with a hard budget.

### Why This Matters for Gravity

Jacobson's derivation of Einstein's equations requires horizons with a
temperature proportional to surface gravity, an entropy proportional to area,
and a first law tying heat to entropy. De Sitter thermodynamics supplies that
structure. In OPH it becomes the natural thermodynamic backdrop for the
gravity relation recovered from observer-patch consistency.

## 13.5 The Problem of Time in De Sitter

In Anti-de Sitter space, there's a boundary at spatial infinity that provides a universal time reference.

De Sitter has no spatial boundary. The only boundary is the horizon-and the horizon is observer-dependent.

### Horizon Complementarity

Leonard Susskind and collaborators proposed **de Sitter complementarity**: operationally, physics should be described patch by patch, without privileging a single global observer description.

Alice describes physics in her patch using her Hilbert space. Bob describes physics in his patch using his Hilbert space. Where their patches overlap, their descriptions must be consistent. In the complementarity reading adopted here, patch-relative descriptions are primary.

A Hilbert space here is the quantum state space for the degrees of freedom
accessible inside one observer's horizon, not a private mental space.

This fits naturally with OPH. Reality is a collection of consistent patches. You can't step outside and view the universe from nowhere.

## 13.6 Static Patch Holography

Where should we put the holographic screen in de Sitter?

A natural candidate: on the cosmological horizon.

For an observer at $r = 0$, the horizon is a sphere at $r = c/H$. This sphere has area $4\pi c^2/H^2$ and the entropy capacity above.

The three-dimensional bulk inside the horizon is treated holographically as data organized on the two-dimensional horizon.

When an object falls toward the horizon, it gets redshifted and appears to freeze onto the surface, its information smeared across the screen.

The horizon is the natural screen for cosmology. It is the last place where
an observer can trade signals with the rest of the patch. If physics is
organized around what observers can compare, then the cosmological horizon is
exactly where that comparison structure has to live.

### Why This Is Not dS/CFT

When physicists say "de Sitter holography is unsolved," they typically mean: no AdS/CFT-like duality with a clean boundary CFT at infinity is available. The classic dS/CFT proposal puts a Euclidean CFT at future infinity. This leads to notorious problems: potential non-unitarity, complex weights, and no clear operational access for any observer.

OPH takes a different path. It uses static-patch holography with
positive Lambda. The boundary is the observer's horizon, not future infinity.
The construction asks for local algebras and overlap consistency, without one
global CFT. Each observer has a horizon screen, and observer-dependence is
part of the setup.

This is a different target. The "unsolved problem" of dS holography is about finding a global boundary theory at infinity. OPH asks how local observer patches, each bounded by a horizon, yield consistent physics.

### The Lambda-Capacity Relation

A key point: the cosmological constant belongs to global capacity rather than
local patch data. Null modular probes reconstruct the stress tensor only up to
a term proportional to the metric itself, so $\Lambda g_{ab}$ enters as the one
global scale the local construction cannot erase.

The symbol $\Lambda$ is the cosmological constant, the part of Einstein's
equation that acts like a uniform large-scale tendency for space to accelerate.
It belongs to the global capacity branch at the cosmic record fixed point.

On the cosmological-capacity branch the dimensionless Lambda-capacity relation
is fixed by a **global** self-reading constraint: the outside total horizon
capacity must equal the inside observer-accessible public record. With the
selected OPH scale bridge, the fixed point is displayed as

$$N_{\mathrm{CRC}}=F(N_{\mathrm{CRC}}),\qquad
\Lambda_{\mathrm{CRC}}=\frac{3\pi}{G N_{\mathrm{CRC}}}.$$

With that fixed point and scale bridge, the observed $\Lambda$ is the way
the world announces its total screen capacity in SI units. The dimensionless
capacity relation is the global size parameter carried by every consistent
patch.

The global closure is sharp. Let $F(N)$ be the active horizon capacity read
back by stable observers inside the OPH universe supplied with capacity $N$.
The cosmic record-closure capacity is

$$
N_{\mathrm{CRC}}=F(N_{\mathrm{CRC}}).
$$

The finite-count representation uses the terminal observer normal forms that
close on themselves at capacity $N$, normalized by the full screen Hilbert
space size:

$$
\Pi(N)=|\Omega^{\mathrm{sc}}_N|e^{-N},
\qquad
N_\star=\operatorname*{argmax}_{N\ \mathrm{admissible}}
\left(\log|\Omega^{\mathrm{sc}}_N|-N\right).
$$

$\Omega^{\mathrm{sc}}_N$ is the set of self-consistent observer-supported
screen records at capacity $N$. The absolute-value bars count how many such
records there are. The exponential factor $e^{-N}$ removes the trivial growth
from increasing the raw screen capacity. The selected capacity $N_\star$ is the
admissible value where this balance is largest.

The same idea can be written as a fixed-point map. Define
$\ell(N)=\log|\Omega^{\mathrm{sc}}_N|-N$. The OPH-derived map
$T_\eta(N)=N+\eta\ell'(N)$ moves $N$ in the direction indicated by the slope of
that balance function. Under the stated derivative-sign condition it has a
unique stable fixed point. Informally, this is the single screen size where
the universe reads back its own boundary without deficit or slack: below it,
stable self-reading records do not have enough active capacity; above it, added
capacity is slack, redundancy, or de Sitter dilution. On the observed branch
this fixed point is the de Sitter entropy capacity.

The image is the important part. The small positive Lambda is read as the size
label of a finite self-reading horizon. It is the number every observer patch
inherits when the universe can reconstruct its own boundary from inside.

This is the informal $N_{\mathrm{CRC}}$ story. From the outside the datum is
total horizon capacity. From the inside the datum is total observer-accessible
public record. Closure says that the universe must be able to reconstruct its
own boundary. Observers exist inside it, and infer geometry, horizons, entropy,
$\Lambda$, history, and records from the information available inside the
universe.

The capacity relation belongs to global screen size: a larger
self-consistent record capacity corresponds to a smaller positive cosmological
constant once the selected scale bridge is used for the SI display.

### Many Observers, One Lambda

The philosophical stance of OPH, no objective camera angle and only perspectives that must agree on overlaps, maps naturally onto de Sitter static-patch intuition. Each timelike observer has a horizon and a patch. There is no operational access to a single global description.

On that same implemented branch, Lambda is the global quantity that
**can** be shared across overlaps. It is a capacity constraint that all
consistent overlapping descriptions inherit. Different observers see
different patches, and they all see the same Lambda encoded in the finite
size of their horizons.

### The Cosmology Picture

The cosmology picture is easiest to state in plain language. When the
entropy-maximizing state is rotationally symmetric for an observer, the
large-scale stress tensor looks like a perfect fluid. When the same isotropy
holds across observers, the spatial slices have constant curvature. Combined
with the gravity relation from the earlier chapters and a positive
cosmological constant, that gives the familiar FLRW geometry used in
cosmology.

### What "Early Universe" Means Here

In OPH, the Big Bang names an effective boundary in a reconstruction made from
records inside finite observer patches, rather than a God's-eye first instant
at which spacetime objectively begins. The CMB, light element abundances,
galaxy surveys, supernovae, and lensing data are real records. The global
story built from them is a powerful model of our branch, with no view from
outside the universe smuggled into the account.

So the "early universe" in this book means the hot dense side of the
reconstructed record: the side where the effective plasma is opaque, radiation
dominates the bookkeeping, and the later CMB surface has not yet become
transparent. It names a record-side limit rather than an absolute origin of
being. Likewise, "cosmic time" is an effective clock that appears when many
local records synchronize, an internal clock rather than an external stopwatch
measuring spacetime from outside.

Inflation is where this distinction becomes operational. Standard cosmology
introduces an inflaton field to explain flatness, horizon coherence, and the
nearly scale-invariant pattern in the CMB. OPH assigns those jobs to finite
observer-screen synchronization.
Flatness belongs to the selected spatial branch, horizon coherence to shared
boundary repair, the near scale-invariant pattern to screen geometry and
release, and the acoustic peaks to ordinary Boltzmann evolution once finite
source data are fixed. The CMB and growth curves are empirical tests of that
source story.

## 13.7 Scrambling and Chaos

De Sitter space is a **fast scrambler**-perhaps the fastest possible.

Information sent toward the horizon gets thermalized, mixed with all the other quantum information. The scrambling time is:

$$t_{scrambling} \sim \frac{1}{H}\ln S \sim \frac{280}{H}$$

For our universe, this is about 4 trillion years. Black holes are the standard saturators of the chaos bound in holographic settings, and de Sitter is often discussed as a fast-scrambling horizon with analogous scaling.

$t_{scrambling}$ is the time needed for initially localized information to
become thoroughly mixed across the horizon degrees of freedom. The symbol
$\sim$ means "scales like," not exact equality. $S$ is the de Sitter entropy.
The number 280 comes from the logarithm of the huge entropy associated with
our late-time horizon.

The smooth, empty appearance of the de Sitter vacuum can be read as highly scrambled information in this perspective.

## 13.8 The Swampland and Anthropic Selection

String theory has difficulty producing stable de Sitter vacua.

Swampland arguments suggest that stable de Sitter vacua may be impossible in consistent quantum gravity. If true, our universe would be slowly rolling down a potential hill.

Even if de Sitter vacua exist, why is Lambda so small (10^{-122} in Planck units)?

The **anthropic principle** offers an answer: if Lambda were much larger,
galaxies couldn't form. If it were negative, the universe would recollapse. In
the simplest fit, we find ourselves in a universe with small positive Lambda
because that is where observers can exist.

## 13.9 Reverse Engineering Summary

Historical cosmology expected expansion to slow under gravity. The sky disagreed.
The supernova data and the standard late-time fit point toward de Sitter
behavior, and de Sitter fits the observer-first picture with almost suspicious
neatness. Each observer has a static patch, a horizon, a temperature, an
entropy budget, and finite accessible information. The cosmological horizon is
the natural screen in this reading.

## 13.10 The Dark Sector: Missing Gravity Without New Particles

In 1933, Fritz Zwicky looked at galaxies in the Coma Cluster and found a
problem. They were moving as if the cluster contained far more mass than the
telescopes could see. Four decades later, Vera Rubin and Kent Ford found the
same kind of problem inside spiral galaxies. The outer stars were orbiting too
fast. If the visible stars and gas were all the mass there was, those outskirts
should have behaved differently.

The modern evidence is broader than rotation curves. Galaxy clusters bend light
more strongly than their visible matter allows. The Bullet Cluster separates
hot gas from the gravitational lensing map. The cosmic microwave background
carries the imprint of extra gravitational weight on the hot dense side of the
standard reconstruction. This is what physicists call the dark sector: the part
of the cosmic budget inferred from gravity rather than from light.

The standard answer is dark matter: new particles that clump around galaxies,
pull on stars and light, and mostly ignore electromagnetism. That answer works
well in large-scale cosmology, but the particles themselves have not shown up
in detectors. MOND takes the opposite route and changes the low-acceleration
law of gravity. It captures a surprising amount of galaxy phenomenology, while
clusters and precision cosmology remain difficult terrain.

OPH reads the same evidence through the observer screen. A galaxy is luminous
matter, dust, gas, and dark gravitational behavior inside a finite de Sitter
patch. The question becomes: what does gravity read when the boundary
bookkeeping is nearly, but not perfectly, additive?

### The Modular Leftover

Chapter 11 used entanglement equilibrium to recover the local Einstein
relation. In the ideal case, the boundary record screens inside from outside
cleanly enough that local gravity takes the familiar form.

The dark-sector idea starts where that idealization stops. A small amount of
correlation can remain outside the boundary summary. OPH calls this a modular
anomaly because it appears in the same modular bookkeeping that turns a
restricted observer state into a clock and an energy accounting. An anomaly in
this sense is the leftover term produced by imperfect additivity.

That leftover gravitates. It changes the effective stress-energy seen by an
inside observer, but it does not shine, scatter light, or behave like ordinary
gas. For a telescope it is dark. For the geometry it has weight.

### The Acceleration Scale

The de Sitter horizon introduces an unavoidable IR length scale:

$$r_{dS} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{\Lambda}} \approx 1.66 \times 10^{26} \text{ m}$$

Galaxy rotation anomalies are an infrared phenomenon. They appear at large
distances where accelerations are tiny. The same de Sitter scale that set the
horizon therefore supplies the natural ruler for the effect.

A natural acceleration scale, carrying the modular coefficient, is:

$$a_0^{(\text{OPH})} = \frac{15}{8\pi^2} \cdot \frac{c^2}{r_{dS}}$$

Plugging in numbers:

$$a_0^{(\text{OPH})} \approx 1.03 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m/s}^2$$

This lands near the empirical MOND acceleration scale
$a_0 \sim 1.2 \times 10^{-10}\,\text{m/s}^2$ that fits galaxy rotation curves.
The proximity matters because it ties a possible galaxy-scale anomaly back to
the same de Sitter capacity logic that fixed the horizon.

### Why Galaxies Flatten

In the deep-infrared regime, where the acceleration from visible matter falls
below $a_0$, the effective gravitational acceleration takes the familiar
MOND-like form

$$g_{\text{obs}} \approx \sqrt{a_0 \cdot g_b}$$

where $g_b$ is the Newtonian acceleration from baryons. For a galaxy this gives
the flat-rotation-curve behavior astronomers actually see.

$g_{\text{obs}}$ is the effective acceleration inferred from the observed
rotation curve. $g_b$ is the acceleration expected from visible baryonic matter
alone: stars, gas, and dust. $a_0$ is the acceleration scale supplied above by
the de Sitter horizon. The square root is the same scaling that makes flat
galaxy rotation curves lead to the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation.

The same picture yields the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation:

$$V^4 = G \cdot M_b \cdot a_0^{(\text{OPH})}$$

Astronomers discovered this relation empirically: the fourth power of a
galaxy's flat rotation speed tracks its visible baryonic mass. In the OPH
reading, the normalization is tied to the de Sitter horizon through the
acceleration scale above.

This is how OPH resolves the dark-sector puzzle in the language of this
chapter. The missing gravity is read as an infrared residue of screen
bookkeeping, dark to light but visible to geometry. No new particle species has
to be added for galaxy rotation curves to feel extra pull. The cosmological
constant and the galaxy-scale anomaly sit inside one de Sitter picture: the
horizon fixes the capacity, and the residual modular term shows up where
accelerations become cosmologically small.

The whole sky matters. Clusters, lensing, the Bullet Cluster, the CMB,
and structure growth are the places where any dark-sector account has to
survive contact with the data. OPH enters that problem by changing the
question: the dark sector becomes a question about what a finite self-reading
horizon leaves behind in gravity once visible matter has done its part.

---

The arena is a finite static patch bounded by a holographic horizon. What populates this arena? What are the particles and forces we observe, and why do they have the peculiar properties they do?

The next chapter treats the Standard Model of particle physics as an effective
structure. The path has three steps: overlap gluing classifies which sectors can
be transported as ordinary compact-gauge data, compact-gauge reconstruction
reads a compact group from those sectors, and the one-Higgs matter package with
minimal admissible selection picks the realized Standard Model branch.

This is **Chapter 14: The Standard Model from Consistency**.
