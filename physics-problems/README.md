# Physics Problem Notes

This folder holds standalone Markdown writeups for OPH applications to named
physics problems and narrow certificate questions. They act as supplemental
articles for public reading and OPH Sage ingestion. They sit outside the
TeX/PDF rendering, website paper-index, and GitHub release-asset pipeline.
Each problem note begins with `## Motivating Result`, naming how the question
entered the queue and linking the laboratory, observational, or certificate
result that made it worth asking.

Each writeup follows the same rule: an OPH explanation must name the
observer-like self-reading structure. The relevant object is a bounded physical
or software patch with local state, visible boundaries or ports, readback,
records, repair moves, and public evidence receipts. Normal forms classify what
survives repair; selection, yield, power, or material performance requires a
branch-specific source law, action, repair ledger, or receipt bundle.

Each note must also separate three questions: what established theory
explains, what physical target remains open, and what OPH adds. In the current
set, OPH's clearest differentiator is the instantiated observer-like
self-reading patch and its evidence/promotion discipline. That does not by
itself make a standard dynamical equation, optimizer, classifier, or likelihood
uniquely OPH.

Use the following evidence vocabulary consistently:

- **assumption / demonstrator:** a declared provisional law or parameter used
  to make the mechanism visible;
- **derived within the model:** algebra that follows from the declared
  assumptions, not a derivation of nature;
- **software-checked:** a finite invariant or receipt recomputed from pinned
  artifacts;
- **empirically supported:** a claim tested against calibrated data and
  predeclared alternatives; and
- **open:** a missing source law, physical bridge, proof, or evidence bundle
  that blocks promotion.

## Writeups

- [Finite-Quotient OPH Baryogenesis Source Theorem](oph_baryogenesis_source_theorem.md):
  exact anomaly/current theorem and source no-go for the matter-antimatter
  problem. It identifies \(k_R\) with the mixed electroweak anomaly index,
  identifies \(\dot\Theta_R\) with a quotient repair current in physical time,
  proves that a CP-symmetric source law gives zero, and finds \(k_R=0\) for
  the natural hypercharge attachment of the OPH \(\mathbb Z_6\) determinant/deck
  phase. A distinct anomalous record attachment and its CP-odd physical repair
  generator are open. The companion
  [audit script](oph_baryogenesis_source_anomaly_audit.py) and
  [receipt](oph_baryogenesis_source_anomaly_receipt.json) recompute the exact
  attachment arithmetic.
- [Ultraluminous X-Ray Sources as Accretion-Record Normal Forms](ultraluminous_x_ray_sources.md):
  a conditional, factorized, set-valued classifier for accretor identity,
  mass, intrinsic Eddington ratio, anisotropy, viewing geometry, and source
  mode. On a single-engine branch with declared opacity, it shows that
  luminosity identifies only $M\lambda/b$; blends and contaminants retain
  separate state spaces. It audits pulsation, dynamics, spectrum, wind,
  nebular, environment, and contaminant receipts, and keeps ambiguity and
  model-set failure distinct from a physical “other” branch.
- [Homochirality as Prebiotic Record-Branch Selection](homochirality.md): a
  conditional derivation and evidence audit separating chiral seeds from
  amplification, repair, and spatial fixation. It derives the symmetry no-go,
  cumulative-exposure law, and source-off error threshold within a Frank-type
  normal form; places autocatalytic, mineral, circular-polarization, and
  parity-violation routes in distinct source terms; and states the finite
  empirical acceptance boundary
  for an end-to-end source-to-fixation receipt.
- [Plasma Fusion and Confinement](plasma_fusion.md): a proposed OPH
  repair-ledger and promotion contract. The note defines the fusion ledger,
  a contracting edge map as a candidate H-mode correspondence, ELM-like events
  as a conditional hybrid jump/reset model, Lawson as a scalar energy
  projection, Hydrosahedron as an acoustic carrier/control specialization, and
  DD products, captured heat, delivered
  load power, and net plant output as separate receipt tiers.
- [High-Temperature Superconductivity](high_temperature_superconductivity.md):
  a conditional materials-audit and inverse-design specification. It keeps
  local pairing, phase order, defect-limited transport, retention, and bulk
  evidence distinct without turning reduced models into recipe claims.
- [Universality of Low-Temperature Amorphous Solids](low_temperature_amorphous_universality.md):
  low-temperature glass attenuation as a conditional saturated rigid-record
  ansatz. The note treats each material as a bounded self-reading patch with
  strain-visible ports, two-basin records, repair or tunneling moves, and
  public acoustic or thermal receipts. Under an explicit one-active-pair and
  event-to-scattering ansatz, it obtains
  $\lambda/\ell=3.2494\times10^{-3}$ without using measured attenuation as a
  numerical source input.
- [Fractional Quantum Hall States](fractional_quantum_hall.md): fractional Hall
  phases as edge/holonomy normal forms, Abelian $K$ matrix recovery, hierarchy
  refinement, non-Abelian repair-sector conditions, and the $5/2$ selector
  non-selection result. The fractional-exciton extension adds optical-module and
  line-fan receipts for material fractionalization sandboxes.
- [Fractional Excitons as OPH Quotient-Sector Readouts](fractional_excitons_as_oph_quotient_sector_readouts.md):
  companion note for the fractional Hall article. It covers material
  presentations, optical modules, line-fan identifiability, simulator receipts,
  and the boundary between a diagnostic fractionalization sandbox and a
  material-specific Hamiltonian/source-law proof.
- [Hadronic Precision Endpoint](hadronic_precision_endpoint.md): shared
  source-open hadronic backend for the fine-structure endpoint, HVP $g-2$,
  HLbL $g-2$, and rare-decay long-distance amplitudes. It requires an
  OPH-QCD quotient ensemble, QCD source-parameter map, finite Euclidean vacuum
  transfer, Ward-normalized current ledger, positive Stieltjes/Jacobi spectral
  export, same-scheme endpoint remainder, and no-target-leak DAG before any
  source-only precision claim.
- [JWST Compact Objects as Source-Release Record Surfaces](jwst_compact_object_source_release.md):
  audit lane for high-redshift compact objects, early massive-galaxy
  candidates, little red dots, and apparently mature black-hole candidates. It
  treats compactness, redness, luminosity, AGN contribution, source release,
  selection, and mass/age interpretation on separate observation and OPH-model
  axes. JWST object catalogs do not, by themselves, confirm OPH.
- [Compact Record Transients](compact_record_transients.md): a `CR1`
  visual/schema audit for FRBs, black-hole recycling, compact record surfaces,
  detector thinning, censoring, point-process likelihoods, controls,
  refinement, and promotion receipts. It blocks claims that OPH explains
  compact transients without rate, host, timing, waveform, exposure,
  censoring, controls, and frozen-likelihood evidence.
- [Gamma-Ray Morphology Claims in OPH](gamma_ray_morphology_claims_in_oph.md):
  morphology-first audit lane for gamma-ray dipoles, Galactic Center or halo
  residuals, and large-scale gamma templates. It requires any OPH gamma
  candidate to be a frozen source-derived morphology, with count-space instrument
  response, foreground alternatives, identifiability, held-out validation,
  cross-tracer tests, and null tests, and blocks extra-photon readings without
  an electromagnetic-current theorem.
- [High-Energy Messenger Coefficient Emission](high_energy_messenger_coefficients.md):
  a conditional finite-MaxEnt coefficient result for high-energy neutrino,
  cosmic-ray, and gamma source ledgers. It maps declared compact-engine source
  moments to coefficients, blocks UHE event-data leakage, and tests a shared
  source-coefficient hypothesis before messenger-specific propagation and
  detector kernels.
- [CMB Simulation Promotion to a Physical Prediction](cmb_simulation_promotion_to_physical_prediction.md):
  promotion ledger for the public mini-universe simulator's CMB-like boundary
  record. It keeps visual/spectrum diagnostics, source-only finite artifacts,
  conditional imported-FLRW routing, OPH-native geometry readout, and frozen
  likelihood-evaluated physical CMB predictions as separate claim tiers.
- [Finite E8/Spin8 Triality claim statement for an Alt(9) double cover](e8_spin8_triality_alt9_certificate.md):
  pending algebraic-certificate specification for the exceptional-symmetry
  sidecar. The exact matrices, lattice bases, orbit enumeration, triality
  intertwiner, and reproducible hash bundle are required.

## Scope Rule

A writeup can close a definition, conditional derivation, audit protocol, or
certificate specification. It closes the underlying physics problem only when
the branch-specific source law, physical bridge, error bounds, and public
evidence bundle also close at the claimed level. A visual or synthetic model is
welcome when its assumptions are explicit, but it remains a demonstrator. A
failed applied branch falsifies that branch; the compact recovered-core paper
is affected only when the failure touches compact-core assumptions.
