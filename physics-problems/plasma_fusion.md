# Plasma Fusion and Confinement

**Status:** solved as an OPH repair-ledger theorem package. Standalone markdown
supplemental writeup for public reading and OPH Sage ingestion.

## Introduction

Fusion is hard in legacy language because reaction products, core confinement,
edge stability, heat exhaust, ash removal, wall damage, tritium breeding, and
plant power all live on different ledgers. The problem statement is to keep a
hot plasma record alive under those constraints and to separate fusion products,
captured heat, delivered load power, and net plant output. In OPH the reactor is
a boundary-repair ledger: H-mode is the contracting edge-collar branch, ELMs are
obstruction/reset cycles, Lawson is one energy projection, and reactor relevance
requires a matched-controller score plus a closed plant ledger.

## Abstract

Fusion confinement is a quotient-visible boundary-repair problem. The primitive
object is the OPH Fusion Repair Ledger \(\mathfrak L^{\rm fus}_r\), a typed
record of plasma state, actuator state, diagnostics, wall state, hard
constraints, mismatch residuals, repair maps, and claim gates. Confinement
regimes are normal forms of this ledger. H-mode is the edge-collar branch where
the edge repair map becomes contracting. ELMs are obstruction/reset cycles.
Lawson is the scalar energy-record projection. DD products, heat, delivered
power, and net plant power live in separate receipt tiers.

## External Benchmarks and Plant Gate

Fusion products alone do not define a reactor. The receipt ladder is

\[
\text{fusion products}
\to
\text{fusion heat}
\to
\text{captured heat}
\to
\text{electricity}
\to
\text{net plant output}
\to
\text{useful availability}.
\]

ITER's public design target is plasma gain \(Q\ge10\): about
\(500\,\mathrm{MW}\) fusion power from \(50\,\mathrm{MW}\) of plasma heating
for \(400\) to \(600\) second pulses. That is a plasma gate. Electricity
generation and whole-plant gain occupy separate gates.

NIF's repeated ignition results are target-level inertial-confinement gates.
The April 2025 LLNL report gives \(2.08\,\mathrm{MJ}\) delivered to the target
and \(8.6\,\mathrm{MJ}\) fusion yield, a target gain of \(4.13\). The
whole-facility and grid-power ledgers remain separate from that target gate.

For a plant claim, OPH uses the plant ledger

\[
L_{\rm plant}
=
E_{\rm grid}
-
\left(
E_{\rm all\ inputs}
+\Delta E_{\rm stored}
+E_{\rm startup}
+E_{\rm shutdown}
+E_{\rm aux}
+E_{\rm consumables}
+E_{\rm maintenance}
+E_{\rm waste}
\right).
\]

The net-plant promotion condition is

\[
L_{\rm plant}>5u_L.
\]

The OPH contribution in this problem is a confinement and accounting layer:
magnetic-confinement boundary repair, edge control, loss-channel closure, and
plant-gate bookkeeping.

## Definition 1: OPH Fusion Repair Ledger

Fix a regulator \(r\). An OPH Fusion Repair Ledger is the tuple

\[
\mathfrak L^{\rm fus}_r
=
\left(
Q_r,
V_r,E_r,
\{S_{i,r}\},
\{I_{e,r},\pi_{i,e,r}\},
\mathcal R^{\rm hot}_r,
\mathcal P_r,
\mathcal H_r,
\mathcal U_r,
\Phi^{\rm fus}_r,
T^{\rm BR}_r,
\mathsf{Gate}_r
\right).
\]

The physical quotient state space is

\[
Q_r=\Sigma_r/\Gamma_r.
\]

\(\Sigma_r\) is the presentation space of plasma, actuator, diagnostic, wall,
control, and evidence records. \(\Gamma_r\) removes gauge labels, mesh labels,
diagnostic channel order, port labels, hidden carrier coordinates, worker IDs,
scheduler metadata, and any label not declared physical.

For a tokamak branch,

\[
V_{\rm tok}
=
\{C,P,E,SOL,D,W,M,H,F,X,G\},
\]

where \(C\) is core, \(P\) pedestal, \(E\) edge collar, \(SOL\) scrape-off
layer, \(D\) divertor, \(W\) wall, \(M\) magnetic system, \(H\) heating/current
drive, \(F\) fueling/pumping, \(X\) diagnostics, and \(G\) controller.

For a twelve-port acoustic carrier branch,

\[
V_H=
\{\mathrm{chamber},\mathrm{fluid},P_1,\ldots,P_{12},
\mathrm{controller},\mathrm{optical},\mathrm{acoustic},
\mathrm{thermal},\mathrm{radiation},\mathrm{load}\}.
\]

Each \(S_{i,r}\) is a local patch state. For a magnetized plasma,

\[
s_i=
(n_e,n_i,T_e,T_i,p,j,q,\mathbf B,E_r,\mathbf v,
Z_{\rm eff},n_0,n_{\rm ash},f_\alpha,\mathcal T_{\rm turb},\ldots)_i.
\]

For an acoustic carrier,

\[
s_i=
(H_{ij},x_{\rm readback},z_{\rm collapse},T_{\rm fluid},
p_{\rm acoustic},R_{\rm records},A_{\rm artifact},u_{\rm drive},\ldots)_i.
\]

The interface maps

\[
\pi_{i,e}:S_i\to I_e
\]

expose boundary-visible data: heat flux, particle flux, current flux, radiation,
neutral flux, turbulence spectrum, pedestal gradient, acoustic transfer matrix,
optical flash timing, detector counts, calorimeter output, load output, and
receipt state.

The hot record is

\[
\mathcal R^{\rm hot}_r
=
(W,\bar n,\bar T_i,\bar T_e,Y_{\rm fus},\tau_E,
\Pi_{\rm stab},\Pi_{\rm exhaust},\Pi_{\rm wall}).
\]

The physical source/loss ledger is

\[
\mathcal P_r(q)
=
(P_{\rm aux},P_{\rm ch},P_{\rm loss},W,\tau_E,Y_{\rm fus}).
\]

The hard constraints are

\[
\mathcal H_r=
\{
q_{\rm div}\le q_{\rm div}^{\max},
\ s_{\rm ped}<1,
\ Z_{\rm eff}\le Z_{\rm eff}^{\max},
\ f_{\rm ash}\le f_{\rm ash}^{\max},
\ D_{\rm mat}\le D_{\rm mat}^{\max},
\ \text{tier receipts closed}
\}.
\]

\(\mathcal U_r\) is the declared repair/control menu: heating, current drive,
shaping, fueling, pumping, impurity seeding, divertor control, resonant magnetic
perturbations, pellet pacing, feedback control, acoustic multi-port drive,
checkpoint restore, or another declared control move.

The scalar mismatch functional is \(\Phi^{\rm fus}_r\). The boundary-repair
operator is \(T^{\rm BR}_r\). The claim gate \(\mathsf{Gate}_r\) records the
claim tier: mathematical, carrier, control, DD product, DD heat, delivered
power, or net plant.

## Fusion Mismatch Functional

Define

\[
\Phi^{\rm fus}_r(q)
=
\|\mathbf r(q)\|_W^2
+
\iota_{\mathcal H_r}(q)
+
\iota_{\mathsf{Gate}_r}(q).
\]

\(\mathbf r(q)\) is a vector of dimensionless residuals. \(W\succ0\) is a
weight matrix fixed before comparison. \(\iota_{\mathcal H_r}\) is zero when
hard physical constraints pass and \(+\infty\) otherwise.
\(\iota_{\mathsf{Gate}_r}\) is zero only when the evidence receipts for the
claimed tier are present.

A concrete residual vector is

\[
\mathbf r=
(
r_{\rm bal},
r_W,
r_\tau,
r_Y,
r_\chi,
r_{\nabla p},
r_{\rm shear},
r_{\rm PB},
r_{\rm KBM},
r_j,
r_q,
r_{\rm ash},
r_Z,
r_{\rm rad},
r_{\rm wall},
r_{\rm unclass}
).
\]

The energy-balance residual is

\[
r_{\rm bal}
=
\left[
\frac{P_{\rm loss}-P_{\rm aux}-P_{\rm ch}}{P_0}
\right]_+.
\]

The record residuals are

\[
r_W=
\left[
\frac{W_{\rm req}-W}{W_{\rm req}}
\right]_+,
\qquad
r_\tau=
\left[
\frac{\tau_{\rm req}-\tau_E}{\tau_{\rm req}}
\right]_+,
\]

\[
r_Y=
\left[
\frac{Y_{\rm req}-Y_{\rm fus}}{Y_{\rm req}}
\right]_+.
\]

The edge residuals are

\[
r_\chi=
\left[
\frac{\chi_{\rm edge}-\chi_{H,\max}}{\chi_L}
\right]_+,
\]

\[
r_{\nabla p}
=
\left\|
\frac{\nabla p_{\rm edge}-\nabla p_{\rm target}}
{\nabla p_{\rm target}}
\right\|_{G_E},
\]

\[
r_{\rm shear}
=
\left[
\frac{\gamma_{\rm turb}-\gamma_{E\times B}}{\gamma_0}
\right]_+.
\]

Pedestal and exhaust residuals include

\[
r_{\rm PB}
=
\left[
\frac{\alpha_{\rm PB}}{\alpha_{\rm PB,crit}}-1
\right]_+,
\qquad
r_{\rm KBM}
=
\left[
\frac{\alpha_{\rm KBM}}{\alpha_{\rm KBM,crit}}-1
\right]_+,
\]

\[
r_j=
\left[
\frac{j_{\rm ped}}{j_{\rm crit}}-1
\right]_+,
\qquad
r_q=
\left[
\frac{q_{\rm div}-q_{\rm div}^{\max}}{q_{\rm div}^{\max}}
\right]_+.
\]

The unclassified-loss residual is

\[
r_{\rm unclass}
=
\frac{|R_{\rm audit}|}{u_R},
\]

where

\[
R_{\rm audit}
=
\Delta W
-
\int_{t_0}^{t_1}(P_{\rm aux}+P_{\rm ch})\,dt
-
\sum_{\ell\in L}
\int_{t_0}^{t_1}P_\ell\,dt.
\]

This residual forces every claimed loss channel into the ledger.

## Boundary-Repair Operator

Let \(F_{\Delta t}\) be ordinary substrate evolution over one repair interval:
MHD/gyrokinetic transport for a plasma branch, or acoustic/fluid evolution for
an acoustic carrier branch. OPH wraps that evolution in a quotient-visible
repair/readout operator:

\[
T^{\rm BR}_{\Delta t,u}(q)
=
\operatorname*{argmin}_{q'\in Q_r}
\left\{
\Phi^{\rm fus}_r(q')
+
\frac{1}{2\Delta t}
\left\|
q'-F_{\Delta t}(q,u)
\right\|_{G(q)}^2
\right\}.
\]

For the edge subsystem \(z_E\), define the free edge evolution field

\[
f_E(z_E;q_C,q_X,u)
\]

and edge ledger \(\Phi_E(z_E;q_C,q_X)\). The local edge map is

\[
T_E(z_E)
=
\operatorname{prox}^{G_E}_{\eta\Phi_E}
\left(
z_E+\eta f_E(z_E;q_C,q_X,u)
\right),
\]

with

\[
\operatorname{prox}^{G_E}_{\eta\Phi_E}(y)
=
\operatorname*{argmin}_{z}
\left\{
\Phi_E(z)
+
\frac{1}{2\eta}\|z-y\|_{G_E}^2
\right\}.
\]

## OPH Confinement Engine

The reactor-relevant OPH architecture is

\[
\text{high-field tokamak or stellarator}
+
\text{real-time boundary ledger}
+
\text{repair controller}
+
\text{strict net-plant gate}.
\]

At each control time, the inferred plasma state is

\[
q_t=
(n,T_i,T_e,p,j,q,E_r,\mathbf B,\mathbf v,
Z_{\rm eff},n_0,n_{\rm ash},\mathcal T_{\rm turb},q_{\rm div},\ldots).
\]

The controller computes

\[
\Phi_{\rm fus}(q_t),
\qquad
\kappa_E(q_t),
\qquad
s_{\rm ped}(q_t),
\qquad
R_{\rm audit}(q_t).
\]

The declared actuator vector is

\[
u_t=
(P_{\rm aux},
\text{current drive},
\text{fueling},
\text{pellets},
\text{RMPs},
\text{impurity seeding},
\text{divertor control},
\text{shape control}).
\]

The OPH controller solves the constrained repair problem

\[
u_t^\star
=
\operatorname*{argmin}_{u}
\mathbb E
\left[
\Phi_{\rm fus}(q_{t+\Delta t})
+
\lambda_{\rm aux}E_{\rm aux}
+
\lambda_{\rm wall}D_{\rm wall}
\mid q_t,u
\right]
\]

subject to

\[
\kappa_E<1,
\qquad
s_{\rm ped}<1,
\qquad
q_{\rm div}<q_{\rm div}^{\max},
\]

\[
Z_{\rm eff}<Z_{\rm eff}^{\max},
\qquad
f_{\rm ash}<f_{\rm ash}^{\max},
\qquad
TBR>1+\delta_{\rm TBR}
\]

on DT plant branches, plus

\[
L_{\rm plant}>0
\]

for plant-facing operation. The promoted plant claim uses
\(L_{\rm plant}>5u_L\).

## Theorem 1: Quotient Well-Definedness

**Statement.** \(\mathfrak L^{\rm fus}_r\) is quotient-visible. If two
presentation states differ only by \(\Gamma_r\)-labels, then they have the same
ledger residuals, hard-constraint status, gates, and readouts.

**Proof.** By definition, all residuals in \(\mathbf r(q)\), all hard
constraints \(\mathcal H_r\), and all evidence gates \(\mathsf{Gate}_r\) are
functions on \(Q_r\). Representatives differing only by \(\Gamma_r\)-labels
have identical readouts. The OPH carrier formalism treats hidden coordinates,
port labels, and substrate presentation as silent when visible interfaces,
records, repair maps, and checkpoints are preserved. \(\square\)

## Theorem 2: Fusion Record Survival

**Statement.** Let the hot-record energy evolve under

\[
\frac{dW}{dt}=P_{\rm ch}+P_{\rm aux}-P_{\rm loss}.
\]

The record survives on \([t_0,t_1]\) above threshold \(W_{\rm req}\) exactly
when

\[
W(t_0)+\int_{t_0}^{t}
(P_{\rm ch}+P_{\rm aux}-P_{\rm loss})\,ds
\ge W_{\rm req}
\]

for every \(t\in[t_0,t_1]\).

**Proof.** Integrating the energy equation gives the displayed expression for
\(W(t)\). The record-survival condition is \(W(t)\ge W_{\rm req}\). Substitution
gives the inequality. \(\square\)

## Theorem 3: Lawson Criterion as Scalar Projection

**Statement.** In a steady scalar projection with stored energy \(W\) and
confinement time

\[
\tau_E=\frac{W}{P_{\rm loss}},
\]

the energy-record survival condition becomes

\[
P_{\rm ch}+P_{\rm aux}\ge \frac{W}{\tau_E}.
\]

On a thermal branch where \(W\simeq 3nTV\), this is the usual triple-product
form after substituting the fusion power model.

**Proof.** Steady survival requires \(dW/dt\ge0\), so
\(P_{\rm ch}+P_{\rm aux}\ge P_{\rm loss}\). Since
\(P_{\rm loss}=W/\tau_E\), the displayed inequality follows. With
\(W\simeq3nTV\) and a fusion source model \(P_{\rm ch}\propto n^2\langle\sigma
v\rangle E V\), rearrangement gives the Lawson/triple-product form. \(\square\)

## Theorem 4: Finite Normal Form of Fusion Repair

**Statement.** Suppose \(Q_r\) is finite, accepted repair steps strictly
decrease a discrete measure \(\mu\), atomic conflict-component commits satisfy
local confluence, and repair completeness identifies terminal states with the
declared confinement normal forms or obstruction states. Then the terminal
fusion state

\[
\operatorname{nf}_{\mathfrak L}(q_0)
\]

is unique and schedule-independent.

**Proof.** Since \(Q_r\) is finite and \(\mu\) strictly decreases, no infinite
accepted repair sequence exists. Termination plus local confluence gives
confluence by Newman's lemma. Repair completeness identifies terminal states
with the declared normal forms or obstruction states. The terminal quotient
state is unique and schedule-independent. \(\square\)

## Theorem 5: Noisy Confinement Tube

**Statement.** Let \(\mathcal N\subset Q_r\) be the exact normal-form set.
Suppose noisy fair blocks satisfy

\[
\mathbb E[D(q_{k+1})\mid q_k]\le \lambda D(q_k)+\varepsilon,
\qquad
0<\lambda<1,
\]

where \(D(q)=\operatorname{dist}(q,\mathcal N)\), and within-block excursions
are bounded by \(A D(q)+\beta\). Then

\[
\limsup_{k\to\infty}\mathbb E D(q_k)
\le
\frac{\varepsilon}{1-\lambda},
\]

with within-block tube radius controlled by \(A\varepsilon/(1-\lambda)+\beta\).

**Proof.** Iterating the affine inequality gives

\[
\mathbb E D(q_k)
\le
\lambda^k D(q_0)
+
\varepsilon\sum_{j=0}^{k-1}\lambda^j.
\]

Taking \(k\to\infty\) gives the bound. The within-block bound follows from the
stated excursion estimate. This is the noisy fair-block consensus theorem
specialized to the fusion ledger. \(\square\)

## H-Mode Edge Gate

H-mode is the natural OPH entry point because legacy fusion identifies it as an
edge transport-barrier regime. The barrier builds an edge pedestal and
raises energy confinement time relative to L-mode, while pedestal stress creates
the edge-localized-mode burden. In OPH notation,

\[
\text{H-mode}
=
\text{edge-collar repair fixed point}.
\]

The contraction diagnostic is

\[
\kappa_E=|DT_E|_{G_E}<1.
\]

The OPH L-H threshold is

\[
P_{LH}^{\rm OPH}
=
\inf\{P_{\rm aux}:\kappa_E<1
\text{ while stability and exhaust constraints pass}\}.
\]

The edge-localized-mode condition is the pedestal obstruction

\[
s_{\rm ped}\ge1.
\]

## Theorem 6: Proximal H-Mode Theorem

Let the edge map be

\[
T_E=\operatorname{prox}^{G_E}_{\eta\Phi_E}\circ (I+\eta f_E).
\]

Assume \(\Phi_E\) is \(m_E\)-strongly convex in the edge metric on the relevant
basin and \(f_E\) is \(L_E\)-Lipschitz with a sign compatible with descent. If

\[
m_E>L_E,
\]

then \(T_E\) is a contraction with coefficient

\[
\kappa_E\le \frac{1+\eta L_E}{1+\eta m_E}<1.
\]

Hence the H-mode edge fixed point exists and is unique in the basin.

**Proof.** The proximal map of an \(m_E\)-strongly convex function is
\((1+\eta m_E)^{-1}\)-Lipschitz. The free edge step \(I+\eta f_E\) is
\((1+\eta L_E)\)-Lipschitz on the declared basin. The composition has Lipschitz
constant at most \((1+\eta L_E)/(1+\eta m_E)\). If \(m_E>L_E\), the constant is
less than one. Banach's fixed-point theorem gives a unique fixed point and
geometric convergence. \(\square\)

## Theorem 7: H-Mode Improves Confinement When Edge Transport Drops

**Statement.** Let \(q_H\) be the edge fixed point from Theorem 6. If the
edge-loss component satisfies

\[
P_{\rm loss}(q_H)<P_{\rm loss}(q_L)
\]

at fixed stored energy \(W\), then

\[
\tau_E(q_H)>\tau_E(q_L).
\]

**Proof.** Since \(\tau_E=W/P_{\rm loss}\), fixed \(W\) turns a lower loss into
a higher confinement time. \(\square\)

## Theorem 8: ELMs as Obstruction/Reset Cycles

Let \(s_{\rm ped}\) be the normalized pedestal stress:

\[
s_{\rm ped}
=
\max
\left(
\frac{\alpha_{\rm PB}}{\alpha_{\rm PB,crit}},
\frac{\alpha_{\rm KBM}}{\alpha_{\rm KBM,crit}},
\frac{j_{\rm ped}}{j_{\rm crit}},
\frac{q_{\rm div}}{q_{\rm div}^{\max}}
\right).
\]

**Statement.** If edge repair drives the plasma toward an H-mode fixed point
but \(s_{\rm ped}\ge1\), and if the repair menu contains a reset map
\(R_{\rm ELM}\) returning the state to the H-mode basin, then the trajectory is
an obstruction/reset cycle:

\[
q_H\to R_{\rm ELM}(q_H)\to q_H.
\]

**Proof.** If \(s_{\rm ped}\ge1\), at least one stability or exhaust hard
constraint is violated. Safe non-ELMing H-mode requires all hard residuals below
tolerance. The state is inadmissible in that branch. If the repair menu contains
an ELM reset and the reset returns the plasma to the H-mode basin, the
trajectory alternates between edge build-up and reset. \(\square\)

## Theorem 9: Loss-Channel Audit Closure

**Statement.** Over a declared interval \([t_0,t_1]\), the energy ledger closes
at uncertainty \(u_R\) when

\[
\left|
\Delta W
-
\int_{t_0}^{t_1}(P_{\rm aux}+P_{\rm ch})\,dt
-
\sum_{\ell\in L}\int_{t_0}^{t_1}P_\ell\,dt
\right|
\le u_R.
\]

**Proof.** This is conservation of energy over the declared boundary. The
residual is the difference between measured stored-energy change and the
declared source/loss integral. A residual outside uncertainty implies an omitted
term or erroneous estimate. \(\square\)

## Reactor-Relevance Score

OPH earns reactor relevance by beating matched conventional control on declared
plasma and plant gates. Let \(C\) be the accepted set of baseline controllers
for the same device, wall condition, field, density, heating menu, and
diagnostic access. Define

\[
G_{\rm OPH}
=
\frac{M_{\rm OPH}}{\max_{c\in C}M_c}.
\]

A reactor-weighted plasma score can be written as

\[
M
=
w_1\frac{\tau_E}{\tau_{E,0}}
+
w_2\frac{P_{\rm fus}}{P_{\rm aux}}
-
w_3\frac{q_{\rm div}}{q_{\rm div}^{\max}}
-
w_4s_{\rm ped}
-
w_5\frac{Z_{\rm eff}}{Z_{\rm eff}^{\max}}
-
w_6\frac{f_{\rm ash}}{f_{\rm ash}^{\max}}
-
w_7\frac{D_{\rm wall}}{D_{\rm wall}^{\max}}.
\]

The comparison passes at effect size \(\delta\) only when

\[
\operatorname{LCB}_{95}(\log G_{\rm OPH})
>
\log(1+\delta).
\]

Useful OPH wins include

\[
P_{LH}^{\rm OPH}<P_{LH}^{\rm best},
\]

\[
\tau_E^{\rm OPH}
>
(1+\delta_\tau)\tau_E^{\rm best},
\]

\[
f_{\rm ELM}^{\rm OPH}<f_{\rm ELM}^{\rm best},
\qquad
\Delta W_{\rm ELM}^{\rm OPH}<\Delta W_{\rm ELM}^{\rm best},
\]

and

\[
q_{\rm div}^{\rm OPH}<q_{\rm div}^{\max}
\]

without radiative collapse.

## Validation Path

Validation uses five gates:

1. Offline scorebook: freeze
   \[
   \mathfrak L^{\rm fus}
   =(Q_r,\Phi_{\rm fus},T_E,\kappa_E,P_{LH}^{\rm OPH},R_{\rm audit})
   \]
   and test whether \(\kappa_E<1\) predicts L-H transition better than a
   declared empirical threshold baseline.
2. Digital twin: run the OPH controller in a validated simulator and reduce
   \(\Phi_{\rm fus}\) against conventional controllers using only data
   available at decision time.
3. Non-burning plasma test: attach the controller to an authorized tokamak or
   stellarator campaign and test lower \(P_{LH}\), improved pedestal control,
   lower ELM burden, and controlled divertor heat flux.
4. Integrated high-performance plasma: satisfy
   \[
   \kappa_E<1,
   \qquad
   s_{\rm ped}<1,
   \qquad
   q_{\rm div}<q_{\rm div}^{\max},
   \qquad
   Z_{\rm eff}<Z_{\rm eff}^{\max}
   \]
   in the same campaign.
5. Burning-plasma integration: promote only after
   \[
   P_\alpha+P_{\rm aux}\ge P_{\rm loss}
   \]
   with the ignition subcase
   \[
   P_\alpha\ge P_{\rm loss}
   \]
   and the plant condition \(L_{\rm plant}>5u_L\).

The OPH-favored reactor lane is compact high-field magnetic confinement with
aggressive boundary control: strong shaping, high-bandwidth edge diagnostics,
real-time profile inference, divertor and impurity control, ELM
suppression/pacing, alpha-heating-aware control, and whole-plant ledger closure.

## Hydrosahedron Carrier Specialization

Hydrosahedron belongs to the carrier/control tier. It tests whether a
twelve-port self-reading acoustic boundary outperforms matched non-OPH acoustic
controls. DD and power claims require the promotion gates below.

Hydrosahedron is the internal name for a small receipt-gated OPH acoustic test
cell: a bounded liquid chamber with twelve drive/readback ports, controller
records, record-conditioned feedback moves, checkpoint continuation, and public
evidence bundles. This writeup describes the mathematical role and claim
boundary only. Detailed mechanical schematics, electrical schematics, CAD
files, component selections, and operating procedures are private.

A twelve-port acoustic carrier has source branch

\[
\mathfrak H_r
=
\left(
Q_H,
H_{P_\star},
\eta_{\rm ac},
R_{\rm records},
\mathsf{Gate}_{H}
\right).
\]

\(H_{P_\star}\) is a frozen OPH-template transfer matrix. The held-out score is

\[
S(P_\star)
=
\log p(H_{\rm test}\mid H_{P_\star})
-
\max_{c\in C}\log p(H_{\rm test}\mid H_c),
\]

with pass condition

\[
\mathrm{LCB}_{1-\alpha}(S(P_\star))>\delta_P.
\]

## Theorem 10: Hydrosahedron Carrier Theorem

**Statement.** If the twelve-port carrier exposes bounded ports, durable
records, self-readout, record-conditioned control, held-out boundary prediction
against matched controls, and checkpoint continuation, then it is an OPH
carrier-patch/control specialization. That result promotes no DD or power
claim.

**Proof.** The listed receipts instantiate the OPH observer-patch tuple:
bounded interface, local state, records, readback, repair instruments, and
checkpoint continuation. Passing those receipts promotes the carrier-patch and
acoustic-control claim. The DD and power predicates use different source,
detector, calorimetry, load, and plant ledgers, so they do not follow.
\(\square\)

## DD and Power Promotion Gates

The DD source law is

\[
Y_{DD}
=
\int
\frac12 n_D^2
\langle\sigma v\rangle_{DD}(T)
\,dV\,dt.
\]

The DD source gate requires source and detector receipts:

\[
C_d=B_d+\epsilon_d\Omega_dY_n+A_d,
\]

where \(C_d\) is detector count, \(B_d\) background, \(\epsilon_d\) efficiency,
\(\Omega_d\) solid-angle factor, \(Y_n\) neutron yield, and \(A_d\) allowed
artifact model.

The captured-heat gate requires calorimetry. Delivered-power requires an
isolated load. Net plant power requires

\[
L=E_{\rm load}-E_{\rm burden},
\]

with

\[
E_{\rm burden}
=
E_{\rm all,inputs}
+\Delta E_{\rm stored}
+E_{\rm startup}
+E_{\rm shutdown}
+E_{\rm aux}
+E_{\rm consumables}
+E_{\rm maintenance}
+E_{\rm waste}.
\]

The promotion condition is

\[
L>5u_L,
\]

or another declared statistical margin.

## Theorem 11: Non-Promotion

**Statement.** The following implications are invalid without the next receipt:

\[
\text{self-reading carrier}
\nRightarrow
\text{DD fusion},
\]

\[
\text{DD products}
\nRightarrow
\text{captured heat},
\]

\[
\text{captured heat}
\nRightarrow
\text{delivered load power},
\]

\[
\text{delivered load power}
\nRightarrow
\text{net plant power}.
\]

**Proof.** Each implication has a countermodel. A twelve-port acoustic system
can pass self-reading control tests without deuterium. A \(P_\star\) template
can predict an acoustic matrix without nuclear products. Collapse control can
improve focusing while staying below DD-relevant temperature-density-time. DD
products can occur at trace yield while the run remains energy-negative. DD heat
can be real but uncaptured. Delivered electrical power can come from
stored/startup/auxiliary energy unless the full plant ledger closes. No tier
promotes to the next tier without the next receipt. \(\square\)

## Theorem 12: OPH Fusion Repair Ledger Theorem

**Statement.** Given an OPH Fusion Repair Ledger \(\mathfrak L^{\rm fus}_r\)
with quotient-visible state space \(Q_r\), fusion mismatch
\(\Phi^{\rm fus}_r\), boundary-repair operator \(T^{\rm BR}_r\), edge repair
map \(T_E\), hard constraints \(\mathcal H_r\), and claim gates
\(\mathsf{Gate}_r\), the following hold:

1. A confinement regime is a quotient normal form
   \[
   \operatorname{nf}_{\mathfrak L}(q_0).
   \]
2. H-mode is the contracting edge normal form
   \[
   \{q:T_E(q)=q,\ \kappa_E(q)<1,\ 
   \Phi_{\rm stab},\Phi_{\rm exhaust}\le\epsilon\}.
   \]
3. The OPH L-H threshold is
   \[
   P_{LH}^{\rm OPH}
   =
   \inf\{P_{\rm aux}:\kappa_E<1
   \text{ under hard constraints}\}.
   \]
4. ELMs are obstruction/reset cycles.
5. Lawson is the scalar energy-record projection
   \[
   P_{\rm ch}+P_{\rm aux}\ge W/\tau_E.
   \]
6. A twelve-port acoustic carrier is a carrier-patch/control specialization,
   with DD and power claims separated by receipt tier.
7. A reactor-enabling OPH controller must beat matched conventional controllers
   by the declared lower-confidence-bound score:
   \[
   \operatorname{LCB}_{95}(\log G_{\rm OPH})
   >
   \log(1+\delta).
   \]
8. Net plant promotion uses
   \[
   L_{\rm plant}>5u_L.
   \]

**Proof.** The quotient and visibility statements follow from Theorem 1.
Record survival and Lawson recovery follow from Theorems 2 and 3. Finite exact
normal forms follow from Theorem 4. Noisy approximate confinement follows from
Theorem 5. H-mode follows from the proximal edge contraction theorem,
Theorem 6, plus the confinement improvement result, Theorem 7. ELM obstruction
follows from Theorem 8. Loss-channel closure follows from Theorem 9.
Hydrosahedron carrier status follows from Theorem 10. Non-promotion follows
from Theorem 11. The score and plant gates are definitions of the promoted
reactor claim. Hence \(\mathfrak L^{\rm fus}_r\) is the mathematical object
that closes the OPH account of fusion confinement as boundary repair. \(\square\)

## Scope

Fusion confinement is the normal-form theory of
\(\mathfrak L^{\rm fus}_r\). The scalar Lawson row is one projection of a
larger boundary ledger. H-mode, ELMs, acoustic-carrier control, DD products,
heat, delivered load power, and net plant power occupy different proof and
receipt tiers.
