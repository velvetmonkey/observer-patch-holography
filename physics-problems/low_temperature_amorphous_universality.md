# Universality of Low-Temperature Amorphous Solids

## Motivating Result

This note entered the queue because the low-temperature glass tables contained
a sharp anomaly: many chemically different amorphous solids showed
nearly the same acoustic and thermal attenuation band, while some amorphous
silicon and germanium films landed more than two orders of magnitude lower
([Pohl, Liu, and Thompson, Rev. Mod. Phys. 74, 991, 2002](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/RevModPhys.74.991)).
Later elastic measurements in dense amorphous silicon even reported the
suppression of tunneling states
([Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 025503, 2014](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.025503)).
The OPH question is why a broad ordinary branch has a nearly universal
readout, while special films can escape it.

**Status:** solved as a source-only OPH theorem package for the saturated
ordinary-rigid-record branch of low-temperature amorphous solids (LTAS).

## Introduction

Low-temperature amorphous solids are hard in legacy language because many
different disordered materials show nearly the same acoustic and thermal
phonon attenuation. Composition, bond topology, density, sound speed, elastic
coupling, quench history, and defect history vary widely. The measured
dimensionless phonon mean-free-path ratio often lands in a narrow band. The
empirical problem is the coexistence of material-specific microscopic history
with near-universal low-energy readout.

In OPH the object is a self-reading rigid material patch. The patch has local
state, strain-visible ports, two-basin records, repair or tunneling moves,
readback by long-wavelength elastic carriers, and public acoustic or thermal
evidence receipts. Material details live in the source branch. The universal
claim belongs to the quotient that removes hidden labels and projects onto the
ordinary rigid-record normal form.

On the saturated branch, one wavelength samples a quotient-visible
rigid-record event with probability

```math
\frac{\lambda}{\ell}
=
\frac{e^{-P_{\rm src}/24}}{12\cdot24}
=
3.2440989\times10^{-3}.
```

The acoustic tunneling-strength readout gives

```math
C_\ast^{\rm OPH}
=
\frac{e^{-P_{\rm src}/24}}{288\pi^2}
=
3.2869594\times10^{-4}.
```

Those values use the OPH source-side pixel, twelve exposed acoustic ports, a
twenty-four-state oriented repair register, and protected-reserve survival.
Measured attenuation, internal friction, thermal conductivity, and tunneling
strength serve as comparison data.

This is a strong OPH result. Against the ordinary amorphous-solid table of
Pohl, Liu, and Thompson, the source value sits only $0.088\sigma$ from the
measured log-center. The same value sits $2.01\sigma$ above the separate
low-attenuation amorphous Si, Ge, and C film pool. The first number is the
goodness check for the saturated ordinary LTAS branch. The second number is the
class-separation check for the known exception films.

## Why Legacy Physics Gets Stuck

The standard tunneling-state model is empirically successful. It represents
low-energy defects in glasses as two-level systems coupled to strain and then
summarizes the acoustic response through

```math
C_i
=
\frac{\bar P\gamma_i^2}{\rho v_i^2}.
```

Here $\bar P$ is a density of tunneling states, $\gamma_i$ is an elastic
coupling, $\rho$ is mass density, and $v_i$ is sound speed. The difficulty is
that the combination is almost universal even though its factors are
material-dependent. Legacy physics can describe the readout once $C_i$ is
given. The source of the dimensionless band is underdetermined in that
parameterization.

Three ledgers need separation:

- the material source law that creates defects;
- the normal form of low-energy two-basin records;
- the quotient-visible acoustic probability seen by a long-wavelength phonon.

Without that separation, universality is a description of the data. The
parameter $C$ becomes a fitted material quotient with no source-side value.

## Why OPH Makes It Solvable

OPH separates the material source branch from the observer-visible readout.
The source branch keeps composition, bond topology, density, elastic tensor,
disorder, quench history, anneal history, and defect history. The quotient
removes hidden carrier labels, atom labels, basis choices, mesh labels, port
names, and repair schedules that leave the public strain response unchanged.

The low-temperature normal form is a rigid-record ensemble. Each active local
sector is a two-basin record with a repair amplitude and a strain dipole. A
long-wavelength phonon is insensitive to the hidden basin label. It records
whether one wavelength intersects an active quotient-visible rigid-record
event.

The port/register fixed point supplies the decisive quotient. On the saturated
ordinary LTAS branch, the acoustic carrier exposes one of twelve scalar ports,
the internal rigid-record repair move occupies one of twenty-four oriented
write/check slots, and the protected reserve survives with factor
$e^{-P_{\rm src}/24}$. The LTAS branch declares the visibility space as a
tensor product:

```math
\mathcal V_{\rm LTAS}
=
\mathcal P_{12}^{\rm ac}
\otimes
\mathcal R_{24}^{\rm or}.
```

This tensor product licenses the product $12\cdot24$.

## Abstract

Low-temperature amorphous-solid universality is the OPH normal form of a
saturated rigid-record material quotient. A long-wavelength phonon sees twelve
acoustic ports, a twenty-four-slot oriented repair register, and the
protected-reserve survival factor. The readout value is
$\lambda/\ell=3.2440989\times10^{-3}$ and acoustic tunneling strength
$3.2869594\times10^{-4}$. The class is ordinary disordered rigid materials
with saturated, scale-flat, strain-coupled rigid records. Low-attenuation
films such as selected amorphous Si, Ge, and C samples fall outside that class
when the receipt conditions fail.

## Claim Boundary

The numerical value applies to the uniform saturated LTAS branch. Its inputs
are $P_{\rm src}$, the screen-sieve twelve-port theorem, the twenty-four-slot
oriented repair register, and protected-reserve survival. Measured
$\lambda/\ell$, internal friction, thermal conductivity, and tunneling
strength are excluded from the source calculation.

Equal attenuation across every amorphous solid is outside the claim. The branch
claim is the quotient-visible leading scattering probability for

```math
\text{ordinary disordered rigid materials}
\quad
\text{with}
\quad
\text{saturated scale-flat strain-coupled rigid records}
```

on the saturated branch.

The branch excludes materials lacking scale-flat rigid records, with sparse
repair ensembles, with biased port or register activation, with non-uniform
protected-reserve behavior, or with suppressed elastic coupling to strain.

## Empirical Target

Pohl, Liu, and Thompson review the low-temperature glass data and report that
the phonon wavelength to mean-free-path ratio is typically in the band

```math
10^{-3}
\lesssim
\frac{\lambda}{\ell}
\lesssim
10^{-2},
```

The tunneling-strength band is

```math
10^{-4}
\lesssim
C
\lesssim
10^{-3}.
```

They also describe exceptions, including some amorphous Si, Ge, and C films
with much lower attenuation.

The acoustic readout convention is

```math
\frac{\lambda}{\ell}
=
\pi^2 C.
```

For the dominant transverse thermal-phonon convention,

```math
\frac{\lambda_{\rm dom}}{\ell}
\simeq
12.5 C_t.
```

The OPH target is this empirical band with no material-by-material fit of
$C$, $\bar P$, $\gamma$, $\rho$, or $v$.

## Source Branch

The source branch is

```math
\mathsf{OPH}_{\rm LTAS}
=
\mathsf{ObserverPatch}
+
\mathsf{ScreenMicrophysics}
+
\mathsf{ProtectedReserve}
+
\mathsf{RigidRecordTLS}
+
\mathsf{FiniteQuotientEnsemble}.
```

The OPH source-side pixel used here is

```math
P_{\rm src}
=
1.630972095694329\ldots .
```

The public comparison endpoint

```math
P_C
=
1.630968209403959\ldots
```

changes the numerical answer only beyond the displayed precision. The LTAS
theorem uses $P_{\rm src}$ because the value is a source-side OPH output. The
measured Thomson endpoint is a comparison coordinate.

The bounded observer-like patch is a rigid material region with strain-visible
interfaces, local two-basin records, repair amplitudes, readback by acoustic or
thermal phonons, and public evidence receipts. Hidden atom labels and
microscopic carrier coordinates are silent unless they change the visible
record.

## Definition 1: LTAS Material Quotient

For a material $x$ and regulator $r$, define the LTAS material branch

```math
\mathcal B_{\rm LTAS}(x,r)
=
\left(
x,
G_x,
\{\mathcal A_i^x\},
H_x,
\Gamma_x,
\mathcal C_{\rm rr},
\mathcal C_{\rm el},
\mathcal P_{\rm proc}
\right).
```

Here $x$ contains composition, bond topology, density, elastic tensor,
coordination constraints, disorder, quench history, anneal history, and defect
history. $G_x$ is the finite structural graph. $\mathcal A_i^x$ are local
accessible algebras. $H_x$ is the source Hamiltonian or action. $\Gamma_x$
is the equivalence relation that removes hidden labels. $\mathcal C_{\rm rr}$
is the rigid-record class, $\mathcal C_{\rm el}$ is the elastic readout class,
and $\mathcal P_{\rm proc}$ records processing history.

The physical quotient is

```math
Q_{x,r}
=
\Sigma_{x,r}/\Gamma_{x,r}.
```

The source law is

```math
\mu_{x,r,T}(q)
=
Z_{x,r,T}^{-1}
m_{x,r}(q)e^{-S_{x,r,T}(q)}.
```

Material law selection belongs to the source branch. Normal-form projection
states the surviving ordinary low-energy rigid-record ensemble.

## Definition 2: Rigid-Record Pair

A rigid-record pair is a local two-basin quotient sector

```math
R_j
=
\{q_{j,+},q_{j,-}\}
\subset
Q_{x,r}.
```

Its asymmetry is

```math
\Delta_j
=
E(q_{j,+})-E(q_{j,-}).
```

Its repair or tunneling amplitude is

```math
\Delta_j^0.
```

For strain component $s$, its elastic dipole is

```math
\gamma_{j,s}
=
\frac12
\left(
\frac{\partial E(q_{j,+})}{\partial\varepsilon_s}
-
\frac{\partial E(q_{j,-})}{\partial\varepsilon_s}
\right).
```

The level splitting is

```math
E_j
=
\sqrt{\Delta_j^2+(\Delta_j^0)^2}.
```

The pair is a record because the two basins are locally stable, readably
different under strain, and connected by a permitted repair move.

## Definition 3: Rigid-Record Spectral Measure

The rigid-record spectral measure is

```math
\nu_{x,r}
=
\frac1{V_r}
\sum_{j\in{\rm RR}(x,r)}
\delta_{\Delta_j}
\delta_{\lambda_j}
\delta_{\gamma_j}
\delta_{\rho_r}
\delta_{v_r},
```

where

```math
\lambda_j
=
-\log(\Delta_j^0/E_0).
```

The active low-energy density is

```math
P_{0,r}
=
\left.
\frac{d}{dE}
\mathbb E_{\mu_{x,r,0}}
\left[
\frac1{V_r}\#\{j:E_j\le E\}
\right]
\right|_{E=0}.
```

The elastic repair strength is

```math
C_{s,r}
=
\frac{P_{0,r}\langle\gamma_s^2\rangle_r}
{\rho_r v_{s,r}^2}.
```

This is the standard material-facing TLS quantity. OPH derives its saturated
branch value by deriving the quotient-visible scattering probability first.

## Theorem 1: Rigid-Record TLS Reduction

**Statement.** Every isolated two-basin rigid record reduces to

```math
H_j
=
\frac12
\left(
\Delta_j\sigma_j^z+\Delta_j^0\sigma_j^x
\right)
+
\sum_s
\gamma_{j,s}\varepsilon_s(x_j)\sigma_j^z.
```

**Proof.** A two-basin quotient sector has a two-dimensional low-energy
subspace. Any Hermitian operator on it is a scalar plus Pauli terms. The scalar
is invisible to the readout. The diagonal energy difference gives
$\Delta\sigma^z/2$. The off-diagonal repair move gives
$\Delta^0\sigma^x/2$. Long-wavelength strain perturbs the two basins through
opposite elastic dipoles, so it enters as $\gamma\varepsilon\sigma^z$.
Hidden basin labels are quotiented away, so the expression is invariant up to
two-state basis rotation. $\square$

## Theorem 2: Scale-Flat Repair Action

**Statement.** If the rigid-record action is smooth in $\Delta$ near zero and
translation-invariant in

```math
\lambda
=
-\log(\Delta^0/E_0),
```

then

```math
dN
=
P_0\,dV\,d\Delta\,d\lambda
=
P_0\,dV\,d\Delta\,\frac{d\Delta^0}{\Delta^0},
```

or

```math
P(\Delta,\Delta^0)
=
\frac{P_0}{\Delta^0}.
```

**Proof.** Smoothness near $\Delta=0$ gives a locally flat $d\Delta$
density. Translation invariance in barrier action gives a locally flat
$d\lambda$ density. Since $d\lambda=-d\Delta^0/\Delta^0$, the tunneling
distribution follows. $\square$

## Theorem 3: Rigid-Record Port-Slot Fixed Point

**Statement.** On the saturated ordinary-rigid-record LTAS branch, the
quotient-visible rigid-record scattering probability per acoustic wavelength
is

```math
p_{\rm rr}^{\rm vis}
=
\frac{e^{-P_{\rm src}/24}}{12\cdot24}.
```

Equivalently,

```math
\eta_{\rm OPH}
:=
p_{\rm rr}^{\rm vis}
=
3.244098917358505\times10^{-3}.
```

**Hypotheses.** The LTAS visibility branch factors as

```math
\mathcal V_{\rm LTAS}
=
\mathcal P_{12}^{\rm ac}
\otimes
\mathcal R_{24}^{\rm or}.
```

The acoustic port orbit is uniform:

```math
\Pr(a)=\frac1{12}
\qquad
(a\in\mathcal P_{12}^{\rm ac}).
```

The oriented repair register is uniform:

```math
\Pr(o)=\frac1{24}
\qquad
(o\in\mathcal R_{24}^{\rm or}).
```

The protected reserve survives with

```math
\Pr(\text{reserve survives})
=
e^{-P_{\rm src}/24}.
```

**Proof.** The screen-sieve theorem gives twelve indistinguishable exposed
scalar/acoustic ports. No-marked-point maximum entropy gives uniform port
weight $1/12$. The reversible write/check repair register gives twenty-four
indistinguishable oriented repair slots. Quotient invariance gives uniform
register weight $1/24$. The protected-reserve theorem gives the survival
factor $e^{-P_{\rm src}/24}$. The LTAS tensor-product hypothesis makes the
acoustic carrier port and the internal oriented repair slot independent on the
quotient. Therefore the visible active probability is the product. $\square$

## Protected-Reserve Survival

The protected-reserve factor is

```math
\lambda_{\rm collar}
=
e^{-P/24}.
```

Using the source-side pixel,

```math
\lambda_{\rm collar}^{\rm src}
=
e^{-1.630972095694329/24}
=
0.9343004881992495.
```

The visible probability per wavelength is therefore

```math
p_{\rm rr}^{\rm vis}
=
\frac{1}{12}
\frac{1}{24}
e^{-P_{\rm src}/24}
=
3.244098917358505\times10^{-3}.
```

This is the OPH source-only value for the universal inverse relative mean free
path.

## Theorem 4: Mean-Free-Path Theorem

**Statement.** If active rigid-record events are independent at the wavelength
scale, then

```math
\frac{\lambda}{\ell}
=
p_{\rm rr}^{\rm vis}
=
\frac{e^{-P_{\rm src}/24}}{288}.
```

**Proof.** A phonon crossing $n$ wavelengths survives with probability

```math
(1-p)^n.
```

For $p\ll1$,

```math
(1-p)^n
\simeq
e^{-np}.
```

The mean distance in wavelength units is $1/p$. Hence
$\lambda/\ell=p$. $\square$

## Theorem 5: Elastic TLS Readout

**Statement.** For the TLS ensemble of Theorems 1 and 2,

```math
Q_0^{-1}
=
\frac{\pi}{2}C,
```

and

```math
\frac{\lambda}{\ell}
=
\pi^2C
```

in the acoustic plateau convention. In the dominant transverse thermal-phonon
convention,

```math
\frac{\lambda_{\rm dom}}{\ell}
\simeq
12.5C_t.
```

Therefore the saturated OPH branch has

```math
C_\ast^{\rm OPH}
=
\frac{p_{\rm rr}^{\rm vis}}{\pi^2}
=
\frac{e^{-P_{\rm src}/24}}{288\pi^2}.
```

**Proof.** The standard TLS attenuation calculation integrates the
strain-coupled TLS matrix element over the scale-flat distribution
$P(\Delta,\Delta_0)=P_0/\Delta_0$. The leading material combination is

```math
C
=
\frac{P_0\langle\gamma^2\rangle}{\rho v^2}.
```

The acoustic plateau relation maps $\lambda/\ell$ to $\pi^2C$. The dominant
thermal relation maps the same source branch to $12.5C_t$. Combining these
readout identities with Theorem 4 gives the source-only value of $C_\ast$.
$\square$

## Numerical Comparison

The source-only OPH values are:

```math
\eta_{\rm OPH}
=
\frac{\lambda}{\ell}
=
3.244098917358505\times10^{-3},
```

```math
C_\ast^{\rm OPH}
=
3.2869594215959025\times10^{-4},
```

```math
Q_0^{-1}
=
\frac{\pi}{2}C_\ast
=
5.163143785766721\times10^{-4},
```

```math
\frac{\lambda_{\rm dom}}{\ell}
=
12.5C_\ast
=
4.108699276994878\times10^{-3}.
```

| quantity | OPH source-only value | empirical target |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| acoustic $\lambda/\ell$ | $3.2441\times10^{-3}$ | $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2}$ |
| acoustic $C_\ast$ | $3.2870\times10^{-4}$ | $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-3}$ |
| acoustic plateau $Q_0^{-1}$ | $5.1631\times10^{-4}$ | typical glass plateau scale |
| dominant thermal $\lambda_{\rm dom}/\ell$ | $4.1087\times10^{-3}$ | $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2}$ |

The values land inside the measured universal glass band using no
material-specific fit of $P_0$, $\gamma$, $\rho$, or $v$.

## Sigma Comparison With Measured Values

The sigma comparison uses the measured tunneling-strength entries in
Pohl, Liu, and Thompson, Tables I-IV. These tables list ordinary amorphous
solids and exclude the separate amorphous Si, Ge, and C exception-film class
of Table V. The entries used here are the numeric values in the $C_l$ and
$C_t$ columns, in units of $10^{-4}$.

Because the empirical spread is multiplicative, the comparison is done in
log space:

```math
\mu_{\log C}
=
\frac1N\sum_{j=1}^N\log_{10}C_j,
\qquad
\sigma_{\log C}
=
\sqrt{
\frac1{N-1}
\sum_{j=1}^N
\left(\log_{10}C_j-\mu_{\log C}\right)^2
}.
```

For the ordinary-amorphous pool,

```math
N=83,
\qquad
\mu_{\log C}=-3.512277129,
\qquad
\sigma_{\log C}=0.330270631\ {\rm dex}.
```

The corresponding geometric mean is

```math
C_{\rm meas,geo}
=
3.0741345\times10^{-4}.
```

The OPH value has

```math
\log_{10}C_\ast^{\rm OPH}
=
-3.483205657,
```

so its measured-table sigma displacement is

```math
z_C
=
\frac{\log_{10}C_\ast^{\rm OPH}-\mu_{\log C}}
{\sigma_{\log C}}
=
0.0880.
```

The acoustic $\lambda/\ell$ comparison uses the same sigma, since
$\lambda/\ell=\pi^2C$ shifts all log values by the same constant. The measured
ordinary-pool geometric mean maps to

```math
\left(\frac{\lambda}{\ell}\right)_{\rm meas,geo}
=
\pi^2C_{\rm meas,geo}
=
3.0340492\times10^{-3}.
```

The OPH value

```math
\left(\frac{\lambda}{\ell}\right)_{\rm OPH}
=
3.2440989\times10^{-3}
```

is again

```math
z_{\lambda/\ell}
=
0.0880.
```

Ordinary amorphous-solid pool, from Pohl/Liu/Thompson Tables I-IV:

- source columns: $C_l$ and $C_t$ numeric entries;
- entries: $N=83$;
- measured geometric mean: $C_{\rm meas,geo}=3.0741\times10^{-4}$;
- measured log spread: $\sigma_{\log C}=0.3303$ dex;
- OPH displacement: $0.0880\sigma$;
- acoustic readout mean: $\lambda/\ell=3.0340\times10^{-3}$;
- acoustic OPH displacement: $0.0880\sigma$.

The Table V exception films have a separate transverse-strength pool. For the
listed amorphous Si, Ge, and C films,

```math
C_{t,{\rm exc,geo}}
=
8.8169\times10^{-6},
\qquad
\sigma_{\log C,{\rm exc}}
=
0.7811\ {\rm dex}.
```

Relative to that exception pool, the OPH ordinary-branch value sits
$2.01\sigma$ above the exception-pool center. Numerically, the source value is
centered on the ordinary amorphous pool and separated from the
low-attenuation exception-film pool.

The two sigma values answer different questions. The ordinary-pool statistic
is the goodness check for the OPH branch claimed in this article:

```math
z_{\rm ordinary}=0.0880.
```

That is the relevant empirical comparison for the saturated ordinary
rigid-record branch. The exception-pool statistic asks a different question:
how far the ordinary-branch value lies from the known low-attenuation film
class. The answer,

```math
z_{\rm exception}=2.01,
```

shows class separation. It is unfavorable only for a claim that the same
ordinary saturated theorem covers those exception films. This article makes the
opposite class statement: the exception films require their own branch receipts,
and their low attenuation is evidence against saturated/uniform branch
membership.

## Exception Boundary

The universal branch covers this class:

```math
\text{ordinary disordered rigid materials whose low-energy quotient has}
```

```math
\text{a saturated, scale-flat, strain-coupled rigid-record ensemble}
```

```math
\text{with reserve-unbiased port/register activation.}
```

The branch fails if any of the following fail:

```math
\text{scale-flat }P(\Delta,\lambda),
```

```math
\mathcal V_{\rm LTAS}
=
\mathcal P_{12}^{\rm ac}
\otimes
\mathcal R_{24}^{\rm or},
```

```math
\lambda_{\rm collar}
=
e^{-P/24},
```

```math
S_{\rm rr}^{\rm sat}
\simeq
1,
```

```math
\gamma_s
\ne
0.
```

Here $S_{\rm rr}^{\rm sat}$ is the saturation score for the active
low-energy rigid-record ensemble. A material with sparse active records,
biased repair slots, strongly suppressed strain coupling, or non-scale-flat
barrier statistics lies outside the universal band.

Known exceptions such as certain amorphous Si, Ge, and C films belong outside
the saturated/uniform branch when their receipts fail the stated conditions.

## Simulator Receipts

A simulator freezes the source value

```math
\eta_{\rm source}
=
\frac{e^{-P_{\rm src}/24}}{12\cdot24}
```

Experimental data enter after this source value is frozen. The simulator emits
receipts for the branch hypotheses.

Required simulator objects:

- `LTASMaterialQuotient`
- `RigidRecordPair`
- `RigidRecordSpectralMeasure`
- `PortRegisterProjection`
- `ProtectedReserveSampler`
- `ElasticTLSReadout`
- `ExceptionClassifier`

Required receipts:

- `LTAS_SOURCE_BRANCH_RECEIPT`
- `QUOTIENT_INVARIANCE_RECEIPT`
- `SOURCE_ACTION_RECEIPT`
- `RIGID_RECORD_TLS_RECEIPT`
- `SCALE_FLAT_REPAIR_ACTION_RECEIPT`
- `PORT_12_UNIFORMITY_RECEIPT`
- `REGISTER_24_UNIFORMITY_RECEIPT`
- `PORT_REGISTER_TENSOR_RECEIPT`
- `PROTECTED_RESERVE_UNIFORMITY_RECEIPT`
- `MEAN_FREE_PATH_READOUT_RECEIPT`
- `EXCEPTION_CLASS_RECEIPT`

The simulator comparison audits branch membership. It verifies whether a
material belongs to the ordinary saturated LTAS branch and compares its
measured attenuation against the frozen source value.

## Falsifiers

The OPH LTAS branch fails if:

- the ordinary saturated branch predicts the universal value and the material
  receipts show non-scale-flat barrier action;
- a material is classified as saturated even though the active rigid-record
  density is sparse or history-biased;
- port and register activation are empirically biased and the theorem uses the
  uniform $12\cdot24$ denominator anyway;
- a low-attenuation amorphous Si, Ge, or C film is treated as a counterexample
  before classifying its branch receipts;
- the numerical value is re-fit after experimental data are loaded.

## Scope

OPH closes the low-temperature amorphous-solid universality problem at the
theorem-package level. The source-only number is fixed on the saturated
ordinary-rigid-record branch. Material-specific claims require receipts:
declared material source law, identified rigid-record ensemble, verified
scale-flat repair action, verified port/register uniformity, and exception
classification.
