# OPH Cosmology And Dark Gravity

This directory develops the cosmological continuation of Observer Patch Holography: repair-charge dark gravity, finite-source primordial structure, observer-screen synchronization, Boltzmann transport, and direct comparison with public cosmological data.

The main OPH papers establish the structural observer, geometry, gravity, and matter branches. These focused companions carry the additional source laws, transfer maps, calibration, and likelihood contracts needed to turn that structure into cosmological observables.

## Dark-Gravity Structure

The dark-sector action already yields a pressureless dilute background and, through its cubic condensed link energy, a spherical deep-acceleration law with baryonic Tully–Fisher scaling. The same action supplies a repair current, stress channel, and coherent-source coupling weighted by $\chi_\nu^{\rm can}$.

Physical promotion requires the canonical repair pair, a relativistic constitutive completion, abundance and lensing maps, CMB and cluster transfer, Solar-System response, and calibrated laboratory receipts to close on the same branch. Existing analytic and numerical comparisons are evidence for developing those maps; the papers state their precise status.

## Reproducibility

Companion code lives in [`../code/dark_matter/`](../code/dark_matter/). The larger simulator and visualization surfaces are:

- [OPH physics simulator](https://github.com/muellerberndt/oph-physics-sim)
- [Interactive simulation](https://simulation.floatingpragma.io)

The cosmology papers are focused research companions and are not part of the core release bundle.
