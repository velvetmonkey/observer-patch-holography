# OPH Cosmology Papers

This directory holds OPH cosmology papers inside the public core repository.

## Release Bundle

- `oph_dark_matter_paper.tex`
  - release-bundle paper for the dark/anomaly stress branch, the galaxy limit,
    cluster and cosmology contracts, and the dark-sector source interface used
    by later CMB/LSS work

## Companion Papers

These files are public technical companions outside the release bundle.

- `oph_cosmology_finite_source_cmb_program.tex`
  - finite-source cosmology, physical CMB boundaries, scale bridge, simulator
    evidence, and claim boundaries
- `oph_inflation_without_inflaton_observer_screen_synchronization.tex`
  - inflation-free branch: flatness, horizon coherence, geometric screen
    spectrum, screen release amplitude, radial lift, and hot source data
- `oph_cosmological_vacuum_and_structure_formation.tex`
  - OPH-native vacuum boundary, fluctuation ensembles, proto-object/worldline
    formation, and structure-seed checks
- `oph_cosmology_data_likelihood_contracts.tex`
  - frozen source artifacts, no-data-use checks, pooled reducers, Boltzmann
    transfer, and official likelihood comparisons
- simulator reference: https://github.com/muellerberndt/oph-physics-sim
- visualization companion: https://oph-universe-explorer.lovable.app

The CMB companion distinguishes diagnostic proxies, conditional physical
artifacts using a frozen imported FLRW packet, and OPH-native physical artifacts
derived from the quotient carrier.
Flat-sector work is likewise split: spatial Levi--Civita holonomy identifies the \(\kappa=0\)
branch, while direct theorem, conditional CMH, or explicit-assumption labels select it.

## Paper Split

Two cosmology papers would be too compressed. The split is five papers:

1. **Dark sector and structure**: the released dark-matter paper, including galaxy phenomenology, transported stress, cluster behavior, and the dark/anomaly source contract.
2. **Finite-source CMB prediction program**: source-only inputs, scale calibration, Boltzmann transfer, frozen likelihoods, and simulator checks.
3. **Inflation without inflaton**: observer-screen synchronization, flatness, horizon coherence, geometric screen spectrum, screen release amplitude, radial lift, and hot source data.
4. **Cosmological vacuum and structure formation**: OPH-native vacuum boundary, fluctuation ensembles, proto-object/worldline formation, and visualization-facing checks.
5. **Data and likelihood contracts**: CMB/LSS/BAO/SN/WL/growth comparison protocols.

The release bundle contains item 1. Items 2-5 are technical companions whose
physical-prediction claims are conditional on the source, transfer, and
likelihood boundaries stated inside each paper.
