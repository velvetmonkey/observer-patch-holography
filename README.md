# Observer Patch Holography (OPH)

> Observer Patch Holography is the observer-consistency theory of everything. No observer sees the whole world at once; each observer gets a local patch; physics is the public fixed point that survives agreement across overlaps.

**French version:** [README_FR.md](README_FR.md)

**Quick links:** [OPH website](https://floatingpragma.io/oph/) | [OPH Textbooks](https://learn.floatingpragma.io/) | [Book: Reverse Engineering Reality](https://oph-book.floatingpragma.io/) | [Ω](https://omega.floatingpragma.io/) | [Blog](https://blog.floatingpragma.io/) | [Tech](https://omega.floatingpragma.io/) | [Simulation](https://simulation.floatingpragma.io)

**What this is:** OPH rests on a single assumption: reality is a
self-referential mathematical structure that explains itself. Everything else
follows from consistency. The architecture and settings of the simulation, the
existence of observers, and the emergent universe they see are forced by
consistency conditions. The decisive demand is that observers agree on the
reality that emerges, and that requirement of mutual agreement pins down our
exact universe. Two coordinates carry the whole construction, a pixel constant
P and a record capacity N, each fixed by its own closure equation
`P = φ + √π/A_T(P)` and `N = F(N)`. Everything else is forced by the five OPH
axioms.

**What OPH gives you:** From that single assumption and five consistency
axioms, OPH rebuilds the architecture of known physics as output of the
construction. On the
recovered-core branch it gives 3+1-dimensional spacetime, an Einstein-like
gravity equation, quantum probability as the algebra of observer records, and
the Standard Model gauge structure $SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)/\mathbb Z_6$
with its exact hypercharge pattern, three colors, and three generations. The
pixel equation reaches the inverse fine-structure constant to a few parts per
million, and the source strong-coupling scale $\Lambda_{\mathrm{QCD}}$ to
about a percent. One term of the fine-structure equation is work in progress,
so the theory reports those numbers as certified map-level landings.

**No dials:** OPH has no adjustable constants. There is no knob anywhere that
can be turned to meet a measurement. Every number the theory reports is either
forced by the axioms or a value it borrows from experiment and counts in the
open, so a reader can audit the construction instead of trusting it. For the
record capacity the borrow is itself a strange-loop feature: the universe's
own Λ readout locates N, since in a self-simulation measurement and substrate
readback are one act, while the closure equation that forces the located
value is work in progress. The
consensus core and the capacity algebra are machine-checked in Lean: 111
theorems, zero gaps. A hostile 42-finding audit reproduced the certificate
arithmetic and found no false theorem in the recovered core.

**Where this stands:** OPH is the first candidate theory in which spacetime,
quantum probability, the gauge structure, the particle content, and the
constants of nature all emerge from one consistency requirement. Quantum
mechanics, general relativity, and the Standard Model appear inside it as
effective descriptions of the consensus fixed point, each recovered on a
declared branch with its premises on record. The theory computes quantities
no other framework computes at all: the fine-structure constant to parts per
million, the 122-order vacuum-energy hierarchy and the 17-order weak
hierarchy from a single exponent, the scalar tilt, the galaxy acceleration
scale, and a forward-test table in which every value carries a kill
condition. Programs of comparable ambition carry adjustable dials, relocate
inside a landscape, or exclude the constants from scope. On that comparison
OPH is the strongest candidate for a fundamental theory of physics on offer,
and its open items are finite, enumerated, and armed as public tests.

If you want the existential answer first, jump straight to **Paper 6.
[Paradise as Fixed-Point Consensus](paper/paradise_as_fixed_point_consensus.pdf)**.
Yes, this universe is a simulation in the OPH
sense: a world built from local points of view that keep records, compare what
they can see in common, repair mismatches, and settle on the stable patterns
all observers can share. No outside computer has to render particle positions
frame by frame. Time belongs to those
observers. There is no master clock outside the universe that everything
secretly follows. A clock is a record-making system inside the world, and time
is the ordering an observer reconstructs from changes in its own records.
Shared time appears only when different observers can line up their local
records consistently. Minds and experience are not late additions to a dead
universe. In OPH, space, time, and matter are stable public appearances
produced by a deeper consistency process. The illusion metaphor is handled
below. The rest of this README gives the mathematics and the tests.

## Informal Description

OPH is the observer-first reconstruction of fundamental physics. It starts from
finite observers on finite holographic screen geometry. Its working basis is
quantum-algebraic: patch algebras, states, trace/Born event probabilities on
declared record surfaces, and generalized entropy are part of the formal
starting point. From that basis, OPH proposes conditional reconstruction branches
for spacetime, gauge structure, particles, records, and observer synchronization;
each branch retains the premises and receipt gates stated in the papers. At the operating level, finite observer
patches carry local records, compare only what their overlaps expose, repair
mismatches through declared recovery moves, and settle into stable fixed points
that survive refinement. The public world is what stays stable after those
local views are made mutually consistent. OPH simulation language names this
self-consistent observer network at the operating level.
The case for OPH is mathematical and empirical: the same
observer-consistency architecture is proposed to recover established physics.
The strange-loop hypothesis explains why a self-consistent world exists and
produces observers: the world gives rise to observers who reconstruct the
simulation that produced them, then build the hardware and software that
complete the loop from within.

In the paper stack, an observer patch means an abstract algebraic object with
accessible algebra, state, record algebra, visible overlap interfaces, repair
instruments, and checkpoint data. A support patch is a geometric chart for that
object, such as a cap on $S^2$ or a causal diamond. A carrier patch is a
physical or digital realization of the same visible interface and record
statistics within a declared error. This distinction keeps the theory from
depending on a particular hardware analogy. The stronger claim that information
and computation are ontologically primary is interpretation unless a branch
supplies a distinct empirical discriminator.

Most theories begin by assuming spacetime, quantum fields, and a list of
constants. OPH starts one step earlier, with finite quantum-algebraic observer
patches whose descriptions must agree where their patches overlap. In the
relativity part of the theory, finite consensus supplies quotient normal
forms. The ordinary 3+1-dimensional spacetime readout and the Einstein-like
gravity equation are recovered only on the five-axiom recovered-core branch:
the compact paper supplies geometry readout, controlled modular flow, the
null-stress bridge, bounded-interval transport, admissible fixed-cap entropy
stationarity, small-ball area variation, tensor upgrade, and capacity closure.
The finite cells are the regulator that keeps the construction concrete before
the smooth large-scale limit is taken.
The three spatial dimensions come from the same screen branch: once
$\mathrm{Conf}^+(S^2)\cong\mathrm{SO}^+(3,1)$ is recovered, the observer-facing
spatial chart is $H^3\simeq\mathrm{SO}^+(3,1)/\mathrm{SO}(3)$, which has
dimension $6-3=3$.

In the gauge part of the theory, OPH asks which internal charges and particle
labels can be transported consistently across overlaps. The visible
fixed-cutoff charges generate a tensor category, but its refinement limit is
conditional on an explicit compact-gauge receipt: coherent surjective boundary
group maps, finite-state extendability, center-compatible finite block
embeddings, finite tensor realizations, and compatible forgetful fibers. On a
cofinal tail carrying that receipt, the reconstruction produces some compact
gauge group. With the explicit one-Higgs matter package and
the Minimal Admissible Realization rule, the selected Standard Model structure
is $SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)/\mathbb Z_6$, including the hypercharge
lattice, three colors, and three generations. Quantum mechanics is the
algebraic information language carried by this observer-patch architecture.
Under the stated compact-gauge assumptions, the same stack gives the Euclidean
Yang-Mills form and a finite repair-gap mechanism. Identifying that mechanism
with the four-dimensional Yang-Mills mass gap requires the declared
multiresolution continuum, reflection-positivity, transfer/intertwiner, and
nontriviality certificate.

The particle-sector numeric status lives in the table under **Selected
Quantitative Values** below; the full audit prose lives in the particle paper
and in [`code/particles/`](code/particles/README.md).

The mechanism is the fixed-point consensus loop. Local observers do not access
a global state from outside. They carry finite patch states, exchange
overlap-visible data, reject inconsistent continuations, and keep the stable
patterns that can be synchronized. Geometry, particles, laws, and records are
the large-scale fixed points of that observer-network computation.

OPH carries zero dials: no measured number appears in a defining equation
([STRANGE_LOOP_PRINCIPLES.md](docs/STRANGE_LOOP_PRINCIPLES.md)). Lanes whose
closure terms are open borrow located working values: a
working P located from measured α under SL-3, a working N located from
measured Λ under SL-4, the cesium SI bridge under SL-5, and the declared
structural selections. Every borrow is counted, and the closure ledger
([CLOSURE_LEDGER.md](docs/CLOSURE_LEDGER.md)) records the standing of each row.
The provenance rule inside that frame is that no measured target or fitted
numerical constant may enter a declared source map. The quantum-algebraic axioms and the
$S^2$ screen remain explicit premises. Quantitatively, the public rows are organized by three
internal quantities: a local pixel fixed point $P_\star$, a
global record-capacity fixed point $N_{\mathrm{CRC}}$, and a scale-setting
ratio $\gamma_\star$. A source coordinate earns that label only when its declared
map emits it without a fitted target; otherwise it is a diagnostic or
comparison coordinate. Measurements can tell us which branch we are on, but source values must come
from the fixed-point calculations. Empirical closure rows are marked below. The
detailed scale discussion is collected once below in **Geometry, Symmetry, And
Scale**.

OPH evidence has the same general shape throughout the project. A claim is
grounded in bounded observer-like patches with local state, explicit
boundaries, readback, records, feedback or repair moves, and public evidence
bundles. The invariant observer-patch history carries the claim across
presentations, coordinate choices, and implementation traces.

## The Spacetime Trap

The first conceptual hurdle is that OPH does not treat spacetime as the
container in which reality happens. Space and time are not things in themselves.
They are stable observer-facing descriptions that appear when many finite
perspectives can be made mutually consistent.

This is especially important for time. Ordinary language treats time as a
background river flowing without observers. OPH rejects that picture. What
exists at the base are observers, records, changes in those records, and rules
for making overlapping records agree. Time is the order an
observer gives to its own record changes. Public time is the part of that order
that can be synchronized with other observers. In that precise sense, time is
subjective: it belongs first to an observer's own stream of records. But it is
not arbitrary. A bad clock, a false memory, or an inconsistent history fails
when it cannot be made to agree with the rest of the record network.

The illusion label works only as a metaphor: the container we seem to inhabit is
an appearance produced by deeper consistency. As physics, the sharper phrase is
emergent public description.

From inside one perspective, the world feels obvious. There is a roughly
spherical field of experience stretching outward, three directions to move in,
and time passing forward. Other observers report compatible contents from
different angles, so the natural guess is that everyone lives inside one
pre-existing spacetime filled with objects. OPH reverses that guess. Each
observer has a local spacetime description generated by its own accessible
records, clocks, horizons, and correlations. The public spacetime, including
the public time coordinate used by physics, is the compatibility layer that
lets those descriptions agree.

This does not make ordinary spacetime arbitrary or useless. It explains why it
works so well. Einstein's equations describe the smooth large-scale grammar of
the shared appearance. The deeper claim is that the shared appearance is
emergent from observer overlap consistency, not part of the world's starting
inventory.

## Geometry, Symmetry, And Scale

Sphere language in OPH is geometry language. In symmetric regulator charts, an
observer-accessible cut can be represented by the two-sphere $S^2$. Those
charts describe angular support geometry. Finite regulator models implement the
patch-and-overlap algebraic constraints exposed by that geometry.

OPH uses one shared screen net idealization and many finite observer patches.
An observer screen is a local access cut on that net, not a separate private
sphere. The $S^2$ chart is not a literal ball with data painted on it.

That spherical chart carries several concrete jobs. Caps and collars give the
local cut data used by modular flow and entropy variation. The conformal
symmetry of the sphere is the celestial-sphere form of the connected Lorentz
group, so the same chart supplies the kinematic bridge to the emergent
$(3+1)$-dimensional spacetime branch once the required cap and modular-flow
conditions are met. On that controlled branch the observer-facing rest-space
chart is exactly three-dimensional. Caps mark cuts and sides of the chart, not
preferred observer points. Record tokens populate the chart only when
calibrated cap responses and an error budget support localization. Finite
evidence may report ambiguity. Spherical harmonics organize angular modes.
Finite cellulations of
the same chart give the regulator surface on which patch ports, edge data, and
overlap checks can be made explicit; they are not by
themselves a Lorentz-invariant continuum.

The finite symmetry anchor is $A_5$, the rotational symmetry group of the
icosahedron. It supplies the icosahedral skeleton behind the echosahedral patch
carrier language: a finite, highly symmetric way to organize ports, overlaps,
and local comparison data without treating the carrier as a smooth ball.

$A_5$ also carries the strongest structural result in the stack, and it is the
closest thing OPH has to a smoking gun: **one finite observer screen emits the
complete Standard-Model gauge Lie algebra, with no matter package, no anomaly
clause, no measured number, and no dial.** A triangulated $S^2$ forces twelve
defect units; the icosahedral placement is *forced, not invoked*, because the
icosahedron is a sharp configuration (three inner products $\{-1,\pm1/\sqrt5\}$,
a spherical 5-design) and by Cohn–Kumar universal optimality uniquely minimizes
every strictly completely monotonic pair cost; its vertex module is
multiplicity-free, $P_{12}\cong\mathbf1\oplus\mathbf3\oplus\mathbf3'\oplus\mathbf5$
— exactly the Standard-Model gauge adjoint under opposite-triplet embeddings;
and an **inner** $A_5$ action (natural here, since finite overlap charts are
matrix algebras whose rechartings act by conjugation) forces
$\mathfrak{su}(3)\oplus\mathfrak{su}(2)\oplus\mathfrak u(1)$ **uniquely** —
because inner automorphisms fix the center pointwise, so $\dim Z(\mathfrak g)\le1$,
while a centerless twelve-dimensional compact algebra would be
$\mathfrak{su}(2)^4$ whose $A_5$ fixed-space dimension is a multiple of three,
leaving $12=1+11=1+8+3$ as the only survivor. **Why this bites:** the Standard
Model *takes* $8+3+1$ as input and explains nothing about it; string theory
relocates the question into a landscape; loop quantum gravity puts it out of
scope. No rival computes the gauge algebra at all. OPH computes it from a screen
built for an unrelated reason — observer agreement — and the same geometry
independently makes $\mathbf3$ or $\mathbf3'$ the dimension-minimal extension of
the oriented face-$C_3$ phase, giving $N_g=3$ with one CKM phase, plus a
dial-free spectroscopy signature ($\ell=2$ is irreducible, so an $A_5$-locked
quadrupole must be **isotropic**). The scope is stated once and honestly: this
route emits the gauge Lie algebra, not the $\mathbb Z_6$ quotient, hypercharge
lattice, or chiral content, which stay on the MAR route; it rests on two finite
source receipts, `RP-A5` and `PORT-CURRENT-INNER`; and the spectroscopy is gated
on a derived source-to-observable transfer. See
[code/a5_closure](code/a5_closure/) for the certificates and full claim boundary.

The same geometry gives a useful sphere ladder for readers. $S^0$ is the first
seed or readout distinction. $S^1$ is recurrence, the loop in which a record
can return to itself. $S^2$ is the horizon screen and public archive. The final
rung means the three-dimensional observer-facing bulk role; on the controlled
Lorentz branch its canonical kinematic chart is $H^3$. No $S^3$ global topology
follows from this mnemonic. Particle taxonomy stays with the Lorentz and gauge
branches.

The exceptional symmetry anchor is the $E_8$ Lie group and its root-lattice
structure. $E_8$ matters because it gives the exceptional closure language
used in the higher symmetry and representation side of the OPH stack. The
binary icosahedral group and affine $E_8$ meet through the McKay
correspondence. This is why $A_5$-icosahedral and $E_8$-type language can
belong to one symmetry story. These names mark symmetry constraints and
regulator structure.

The scale story has three roles, kept together here. The local coordinate
$P_\star$ is the screen-pixel fixed point. The global coordinate
$N_{\mathrm{CRC}}$ is the record-capacity fixed point. The scale ratio
$\gamma_\star$ connects the dimensionless OPH geometry to SI units after the
dimensionless fixed points have been computed.

The two fixed-point equations are:

```math
P_\star=\varphi+\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{A_T(P_\star)}
```

and

```math
N_{\mathrm{CRC}}=F(N_{\mathrm{CRC}}),
```

where $F(N)$ is the horizon capacity read back by observers inside the universe
supplied with capacity $N$. Informally, $N_{\mathrm{CRC}}$ is the capacity at
which the universe can read back its own boundary without deficit or slack. The
finite-count target behind that global capacity is the density

```math
\log|\Omega^{\mathrm{sc}}_N|-N.
```

The scale-setting rule is:

```math
\gamma_\star=\frac{\ell_\star\nu_{\mathrm{Cs}}}{c}
```

with $B_\star=3\pi/\ell_\star^2$ and
$G_{\mathrm{SI}}=c^3\ell_\star^2/\hbar$. Observations can identify the
neighborhood or branch, but they do not replace these fixed-point calculations.

$P_\star$ feeds the fine-structure row, gauge
structure, particle rows, records, and observer synchronization.
$N_{\mathrm{CRC}}$ feeds the cosmological row. The scale rule fixes the Newton
normalization and Planck-scale display. In geometric units,
$\Lambda_{\mathrm{CRC}}=3\pi/(G_{\mathrm{geom}}N_{\mathrm{CRC}})$ with
$G_{\mathrm{geom}}=\ell_\star^2$. The electroweak hierarchy bridge, the
24-slot repair normalization, QCD/hadron policy, and hardware receipt rules
live in the particle paper, [`HADRON.md`](docs/HADRON.md), and the hardware-facing
papers. This README only points to them.

### Selected Quantitative Values

This table keeps the values easiest to compare with PDG/NIST and names their
support status. Structural results such as 3+1 spacetime, the Standard Model quotient,
exact hypercharge, $N_c=3$, and $N_g=3$ live in the papers.
The ledger emits no nonzero source-only physical particle mass. Conditional
chart values appear below with their chart names; each value holds only on its
stated chart, and the strict ledger keeps every such row non-promotable.

| Quantity | Symbol | OPH / support status | PDG/NIST | Δ / note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gravitational constant | G | unit-bookkeeping identity on the SL-5 scale bridge: the caesium clock rule carries $G_{\mathrm{geom}}=\ell_\star^2$ to the SI display through $G_{\mathrm{SI}}=c^3\ell_\star^2/\hbar$; G is an input | 6.67430(15)e-11 | bridge input, not a prediction; no sigma applies |
| Speed of light | c | structural Lorentz speed of the recovered spacetime branch; the SI number is a unit convention | 299792458 exact by definition | not a numeric prediction |
| Fine-structure (inv) | $\alpha^{-1}$ | source-only forward map contracts to 136.994835177413, the interval-certified unique fixed point of the declared map (`code/P_derivation/runtime/p_interval_contraction_certificate_2026-07-14.json`; the printed tail 136.994835164622 is an unconverged-run artifact, superseded beyond digit 9, ledger row CL-6). The residual to the SL-3 basin is the open hadronic transport term, closure row CL-1 in [CLOSURE_LEDGER.md](docs/CLOSURE_LEDGER.md) (3.0e-4 relative, about 2e6 measurement sigma). The self-consistent gauge-width map has certified fixed point 137.035660136946577: row CL-2, 2.5e-6 relative, the same missing term; the display value 137.03595950081728 is a mixed-provenance display packet, not a fixed point of any single declared map. The empirical hadron-closure endpoint 136.26365894312011 on [136.15838328342668, 136.36909752396569] uses measured $e^+e^-\to$ hadrons data | 137.035999177(21): the SL-3 test value that locates the working P, on no output list | closure rows, not predictions. The strict source branch needs Ward-projected transport under a corrected successor whose complete method is frozen before withheld data, or an audited clean-room run. Historical v2 is invalid and corrective v3 is inactive; the empirical endpoint leaves the same-scheme anchor gap [0.648554111145163, 0.854792066592563] |
| Record capacity | N | the record-capacity closure $N=F(N)$ is work in progress; N is located from the Λ readout, a basin location the strange-loop structure licenses (the universe's own readback supplies the value). The conditional bridge $N=\pi e^{6\pi/(P\alpha_U)}$ lands at 3.53×10¹²² and writes the 122-order vacuum-energy hierarchy as one exponential of the gauge coupling with zero continuous freedom; the menu-priced corrected band sits 0.03σ from measurement (row CL-3) | 3.31×10¹²² located from measured Λ | 6.6% gap for the uncorrected bridge; a Λ determination at 1% precision separates the corrected band from the uncorrected bridge at 6.5σ |
| Scalar tilt | $n_s$ | 0.9660215 on the conditional analytic screen branch ($1-P_\star/48$), from two candidate formulas | 0.9649(42) (Planck) | +0.27σ comparison row |
| Massive electroweak and Higgs sector (W, Z, Higgs, top) | $W,Z,H,t$ | the strict source-audit chart emits $(80.330,\,91.119)$ GeV. It does not specify the renormalized vev, tadpole prescription, threshold matching, running-input policy, finite two-loop completion, or complex-pole conversion, so these coordinates are not physical $W/Z$ mass predictions. The Higgs/top criticality family gives $(125.77,\,172.63)$ GeV at a frozen boundary-scale candidate, while the declared-surface fit $(125.20,\,172.35)$ GeV is target-anchored; no source-only physical mass is emitted | PDG values are comparison data only; the old $(80.3692,\,91.1880)$ pair was a mass-dependent-width Breit--Wigner convention, not a measured complex-pole pair | no $W/Z$ residual or pull is meaningful before a complete, scheme-declared map and theory uncertainty exist. The pole packets are prescription diagnostics: their one-loop outputs vary by about 1.85 GeV for W and 1.72 GeV for Z over the declared scale scan, and the advertised two-loop packet is an MSSM-one-loop plus SM-two-loop hybrid rather than a complete OPH calculation |
| Charged leptons (electron, muon, tau) | $e,\mu,\tau$ | no source-only physical mass emitted. The declared MCPR response architecture emits the conditional triple $(m_e,m_\mu,m_\tau)=(0.51096,\,105.649,\,1776.78)$ MeV at a coherent $-84$ ppm offset with zero runtime charged reference; the icosahedral face-corner carrier fixes the family structure | $0.5109989$, $105.6584$, $1776.93$ MeV | the MCPR triple is a declared model-input architecture, not a source-only prediction; the source-only completion is the open A5/W5 orbit program |
| Light-quark spectrum (up, down, strange, charm, bottom) | $u,d,s,c,b$ | no nonzero source-only physical mass emitted: the source equations produce two ordered Yukawa profile rays but leave their spreads free. The top is not in this sector; its Yukawa is fixed by the Higgs criticality law (see the electroweak/Higgs row) | common-scale Yukawa data used only for audit | the five light-quark source equations leave a proven two-modulus non-identifiability; a source-derived flavor-orbit selector is the missing object. This is a proven non-entailment, not an arithmetic gap |
| Strong-coupling scale | $\Lambda_{\mathrm{QCD}}^{(3)}$ | 0.3348 GeV [0.319, 0.350]: dimensional transmutation of the source strong coupling, no hadronic input anywhere | 0.338(12) GeV (published) | central value within ~1% of the published value and inside its uncertainty; conditional on declared threshold inputs (bracket-swept); this is the perturbative half of every light-hadron mass |
| Nucleon mass | $m_N$ | 0.929 GeV [0.823, 1.043]: source $\Lambda_{\mathrm{QCD}}$ times the published lattice-QCD ratio $m_N/\Lambda_{\mathrm{QCD}}\approx2.775$ (`oph_plus_external_qcd_theory`) | 0.9389 GeV | −1.1% compare-only conditional consistency check: OPH fixes the strong scale to ~2%, established lattice QCD converts scale into hadron mass. The lattice ratio is an external theory input whose own calibration ancestry includes measured hadronic scale-setting |
| Neutrino sector (mixing and masses) | $U_{\mathrm{PMNS}},m_\nu$ | no nonzero source-only physical mass or mixing row emitted: the weighted-cycle mixing candidate is built from a hand-written family template | NuFIT 6.1 used only for audit | the isotropic ansatz is excluded and the target-informed weighted-cycle candidate fails the correlated profile |
| Electromagnetic carrier (photon) | $\mu_{\gamma,\mathrm{hard}}^2$ | zero: the unbroken electromagnetic gauge symmetry of the declared Maxwell action forbids a hard mass term; two classical transverse modes; quantum photon pole not promoted | photon-mass bound <1e-18 eV | classical action gate only |
| Color carrier (gluons) | $\mu_{\mathrm{YM,hard}}^2$ | zero: the unbroken color gauge symmetry of the perturbative pure-Yang--Mills action forbids a hard mass term; no free-particle claim in confined QCD | no isolated free-gluon mass row | deconfinement/quantum pole gate open |
| Gravitational TT carrier (graviton) | $\mu_{\mathrm{FP,hard}}^2$ | zero: the coordinate freedom of the pure-Einstein action forbids a hard mass parameter for the two classical TT modes; quantum graviton pole not constructed | dispersion bound often reported as <1e-32 GeV | classical action gate only |

$\Delta$ reports the sigma distance where PDG or NIST quotes a one-standard-deviation
uncertainty. Otherwise it records the declared support status. A numerical
match counts as a source-only mass prediction only when every upstream object
is source-closed and the physical mass convention has its own certificate. A
conditional implication or an exact adapter stays on its stated audit
surface. The particle paper gives the support status for the electroweak,
charged-lepton, quark, neutrino and hadron derivations.

## Papers

Ordered by importance for a technical reader. Longer summaries mark the
papers that carry the core theorem surface.

- **Paper 2. [Recovering Relativity and the Standard Model from Observer Overlap Consistency](paper/recovering_relativity_and_standard_model_structure_from_observer_overlap_consistency_compact.pdf)**: compact technical core for the recovered OPH branch. It states the observer-overlap route to Lorentz structure, the Einstein-like gravity branch on the five-axiom recovered core, the formal algebra core that upgrades rest-frame data to the tensor equation and fixes the metric residue to one $\Lambda$ on connected conserved branches, receipt-conditional compact-gauge reconstruction, the selected Standard Model quotient and matter package with a formal hypercharge and $Z_6$ algebra core, the Borel-Weil local carrier for the one-Higgs slot, Maxwell after an independently supplied electromagnetic action, the separate classical-carrier/quantum-particle gate, and the conditional Yang-Mills mass-gap route under its continuum, reflection-positivity, transfer/intertwiner, and nontriviality assumptions.
- **Paper 1. [Observers Are All You Need](paper/observers_are_all_you_need.pdf)**: broad synthesis and best first read for the full program. It explains finite observer patches, overlap consistency, records, repair moves, the recovered effective universe, the scale story, and the public claim boundaries without replacing the compact paper's theorem ledger.
- **Paper 3. [Deriving the Particle Zoo from Observer Consistency](paper/deriving_the_particle_zoo_from_observer_consistency.pdf)**: particle-sector derivation and audit surface. It carries the $P_\star$-driven reconstruction, conditional action-level carrier modes with open quantum-particle gates, the Borel-Weil one-Higgs carrier bridge, electroweak/Higgs/top, quark, charged-lepton, neutrino, and hadron lanes, quantitative checks, and conditional record-worldline stitching. The electroweak chart reports $(80.330,\,91.119)$ GeV, but its map to physical complex poles is incomplete, so the coordinates carry no mass residual or pull. The double-criticality Higgs/top family reports $(125.77,\,172.63)$ GeV at a frozen boundary-scale candidate. Its audit ledger keeps the selected-carrier chart, conditional five-premise value law, and target-anchored declared-surface fit separate; none supplies a physical complex-pole theorem. The fine-structure audit distinguishes the source/root witness, mixed-provenance no-hadron diagnostic, empirical $e^+e^-\to$ hadrons endpoint, and measured endpoint. The generic quark interface has six common-scale dimensionless Yukawa coordinates, and the reciprocal-ray candidate fails its exact identity at every tested scale. Historic mixed-convention residuals and the completed simulator runs are diagnostics; the simulator measures no quark/Higgs operator, while direct-carrier assays remain Haar-rank-one and miss the required transport shapes. The charged-lepton lane records the exact icosahedral face-corner carrier theorem, the conditional CFQ weight theorem, an engineered finite digital self-reading patch, and a conditional nature/pole transport theorem. The latter assumes the physical Yukawa response and singularity readout it transports; its zero-self-energy kernel does not supply the interacting charged kernel. Physical charged-sector selection, target-free ancestry, cofinal physical refinement, and infrared-complete pole attachment remain open. The isotropic neutrino ansatz is excluded, and the weighted-cycle comparison candidate fails the NuFIT 6.1 correlated profile. No nonzero source-only physical particle mass, physical neutrino mixing matrix, or absolute neutrino mass row is emitted.
- **Paper 4. [Reality as a Consensus Protocol](paper/reality_as_consensus_protocol.pdf)**: finite patch-net consensus mechanics. It proves how local observers compare overlap records, apply repair moves, handle defects, and converge to quotient normal forms when the fixed-cutoff assumptions hold. The consensus result stops at quotient normal forms; Lorentzian and Einstein geometry enter through the separate geometric branch in the compact paper. The repair operator is stated on the physical quotient, repaired readouts are invariant under hidden implementation choices, a finite layered carrier witnesses boundary reconstruction, and a finite binary audit fixture gives sharp positive/negative repair and boundary-reconstruction tests. The neutral mathematical companion proves the generic cross-source criterion, but same-boundary physical uniqueness requires the declared boundary map to identify the consistent quotient; same-source confluence and liveness are separate obligations.
- **Paper 5. [Federated Echosahedral Screen Microphysics](paper/screen_microphysics_and_observer_synchronization.pdf)**: finite carrier and observer-record surface. It gives the echosahedral multi-port patch-carrier architecture, twelve-port screen-sieve theorem, the $A_5/C_3$ face-corner bundle with its explicit physical-carrier boundary, and the engineered fixed-cutoff CFQ central-record model with its dynamical-selection boundary, alongside edge-center scalar-slot completeness, the finite scalar channel bridge, the quotient-edge $Z_6$ reserve, public hardware-evidence rules, records, recovery moves, checkpoint restoration, and observer synchronization.
- **Paper 6. [Paradise as Fixed-Point Consensus](paper/paradise_as_fixed_point_consensus.pdf)**: speculative meaning-layer synthesis outside the recovered physics theorem package. It reads the same OPH machinery as a theory of observer continuation, paradise and hell as continuation environments, resurrection as record-preserving continuation, justice as harm-and-repair bookkeeping, and a strange loop in which observers reverse engineer and build continuation machinery.

## Supplemental Papers And Notes

These support or test the core stack. The most important items get more detail;
lower-level notes are linked with shorter summaries.

- **[Observation-Determined Normal Forms](extra/observable_normal_forms.pdf)**: standalone, substrate-neutral mathematics for constraint and rewrite systems. It separates same-source confluence, cross-source identification from protected observations, normalization and liveness, and local repairability. It adds residual and inverse-observation stability moduli, refinement and inverse-limit bounds, the finite weighted conditional-expectation projector with a noncircular matrix receipt, and a dedicated Lean artifact for the formalized theorem subset.
- **[Observer Patch Holography as a Strange-Loop Self-Simulation: The Claim Lattice and Its Closure Status](extra/compact_proof_of_oph.pdf)**: the compact argument for OPH. It states the strange-loop principles once, walks the recovered-physics theorem legs, and presents each number row with its closure status. It reports a pull only when the theoretical and measurement coordinates are commensurate and the required uncertainty model exists. It also names the artifacts that carry the theory: uniqueness certificates and a closure ledger at zero under blind completions.
- **[OPH Falsification Program](docs/OPH_FALSIFICATION_PROGRAM.md)**: public kill-list for OPH. It names hard failure modes, including failure of a fully specified classical carrier receipt or of a separately completed quantum pole receipt, gauge-mediated proton decay, extra light matter generations, charge-lattice outliers, and the excluded universal Solar-System extension of the static dark-response equation. A neutrino or cosmology result can falsify an OPH claim only when it excludes a prediction fixed independently of the test data.
- **[The Fine-Structure Constant as an OPH Pixel Fixed Point](extra/fine_structure_constant_derivation.pdf)**: source fixed-point calculation for the fine-structure row. It separates the OPH source value, the low-energy empirical endpoint boundary, the provenance distinction between the source root and the CODATA comparison pixel, and the remaining QCD/hadronic correction.
- **[Explaining the Yang-Mills Mass Gap with Observer-Patch Repair Dynamics](extra/yang_mills_gap_clay_problem.pdf)**: finite OPH repair-gap mechanism. The Clay-facing statement is a conditional identity: the repair gap equals the four-dimensional Yang-Mills mass gap only if the declared multiresolution continuum, reflection-positivity, transfer/intertwiner, and nontriviality certificates hold, and none of those certificates is supplied.
- **[Observer-Patch Holography as a String-Vacuum Selector](extra/observer_patch_holography_as_string_vacuum_selector.pdf)**: string theory as an effective OPH edge language and vacuum-selection sieve. The Bouchard-Donagi result supplies a visible massless-cohomology candidate; certificates not emitted here include the critical edge, raw cohomology reproduction, safety-layer realization, heavy spectrum, low-energy decoupling, thresholds, and moduli locking.
- **[Photonic Fixed-Point Consensus for SHA-256d Proof of Work](extra/Photonic_fixed-point_consensus_for_SHA-256d_proof_of_work.pdf)**: hardware-facing test of OPH-style photonic candidate enrichment for SHA-256d, judged by the exact digital verifier.
- **[Thinking as Patch-Net Fixed-Point Search](extra/thinking_as_patch_net_fixed_point_search.pdf)**: cognition and qualia as recurrent patch consensus across neural or artificial self-reading substrates.
- **[Theoretical Bounds on χν in Observer-Patch Holography](extra/chi_nu_susceptibility_bounds.pdf)**: coherent-matter same-channel theorem, finite channel bridge, protected-reserve collar coefficient $\chi_\nu^{\mathrm{can}}=1-P_\chi/24$, finite-thickness band, conservation-law energy cage, and engineering chart values with device force and cosmological dark stress kept as separate receipt gates.
- **[Entanglement Geometry Problem in OPH](docs/ENTANGLEMENT_GEOMETRY_PROBLEM_OPH.md)**: note on entanglement geometry as an observer-overlap and record-surface problem.
- **[Common Objections](docs/COMMON_OBJECTIONS.md)**: short responses to frequent conceptual and technical objections.
- **[Hacking the Simulation: Anti-Gravity Exploit](extra/hacking-the-simulation-anti-gravity-exploit.pdf)**: pop-science OPH-adjacent engineering book about the local chi-nu lift test. The [Markdown source chapters](extra/hacking-the-simulation-anti-gravity-exploit/) are included with the repo so OPH Sage can ingest the same text during re-ingestion.

## Cosmology Papers

The cosmology branch lives in [`cosmology/`](cosmology/README.md). Its claims
are conditional on OPH-native source, transfer, and likelihood boundaries; FLRW
machinery can serve as comparison plumbing but does not by itself promote an
OPH-native cosmology result.

The round-one public-data audit gives three encouraging conditional checks. The
fixed $\mathbb Z_6$ galaxy response has an aggregate RAR scatter of $0.132834$
dex; the BTFR exponent $4$ is $1.80\sigma$ from an error-aware fit; and the
analytic candidate $n_s=1-P_\star/48=0.9660215$ is $0.27\sigma$ from the Planck
summary, with a conventional 83-bin CAMB diagnostic only $\Delta\chi^2=+0.83$
above its Planck-like baseline. These are retrospective or conditional
comparison receipts, not frozen predictions. The same static dark-response
equation is excluded as a universal Solar-System law by the Cassini quadrupole
summary (about $19.22\sigma$ on the fixed $\mathbb Z_6$ input), so the
old-settled-galaxy branch needs a source-derived applicability rule. The
cosmology rows are conditional comparison receipts, and a frozen
physical-prediction receipt for this branch is work in progress.

- **[Observer-Patch Holography and the Dark Matter Phenomenon](cosmology/oph_dark_matter_paper.pdf)**: release-bundle cosmology paper. It treats dark/anomaly stress as imperfect observer-patch repair bookkeeping, imports the quotient-edge scalar, finite channel bridge, and $Z_6$ finite-thickness theorem stack for the local coefficient, gives the galaxy-limit/MOND-like behavior, reports the audited RAR, BTFR, and Cassini applicability checks, defines the source-only anomaly abundance selector, and states the cluster, cosmology, and simulator promotion contracts for larger-scale promotion.
- **[OPH Cosmology as a Finite-Source Prediction Program](cosmology/oph_cosmology_finite_source_cmb_program.pdf)**: CMB-facing program for source-only inputs, scale calibration, Boltzmann transfer, simulator checks, physical CMB boundaries, and claim labels. It reports the conditional analytic $P_\star/48$ tilt comparison and treats source-only dark abundance as a separate source receipt from CMB transfer and likelihood promotion.
- **[Inflation Without an Inflaton](cosmology/oph_inflation_without_inflaton_observer_screen_synchronization.pdf)**: inflation-free branch using observer-screen synchronization, horizon coherence, flatness conditions, geometric screen spectrum, screen release amplitude, radial lift, and hot source data.
- **[OPH Cosmological Vacuum and Structure Formation](cosmology/oph_cosmological_vacuum_and_structure_formation.pdf)**: OPH-native vacuum boundary, fluctuation ensembles, proto-object/worldline formation, and structure-seed checks.
- **[OPH Cosmology Data and Likelihood Contracts](cosmology/oph_cosmology_data_likelihood_contracts.pdf)**: frozen source artifacts, no-data-use receipts, the round-one audited comparison ledger, pooled reducers, Boltzmann-transfer comparisons, and official likelihood protocols.

pipeline.

## Proof Status And Falsification Program

**Where the proof stands.** The mathematical core is audit-hardened. A
42-finding adversarial audit reproduced the certificate arithmetic and found
no false theorem in the recovered core. The two implementation defects it
exposed (a hadronic target-coordinate algebra error and a finite-clock
eligibility predicate) are repaired with fail-closed gates and adversarial
regression tests. The P certificates prove exactly one fixed point per
declared map on its maximal analytic domain, with an empty exclusion list:
no landscape exists anywhere, on or off the physical window. The regulator
gluing layer carries a machine-verified evidence bundle with a constructive
supply lemma on the realized echosahedral branch; boundary-fiber
identifiability is proved sorry-free in Lean on the declared verified
domain; the central-interface collar clause carries a proof of independence,
so it is priced as a permanent named input rather than an unexamined
assumption; and the collar-opportunity Poisson law is theorem grade with
explicit constants. The physical Thomson completion is the headline open
computation. The record-capacity closure $N = F(N)$ is work in progress: the
located capacity is on record from the Λ readout, the conditional bridge
writes the 122-order vacuum hierarchy as one exponential of the gauge
coupling, and the corrected band carries a 6.5σ forward discrimination at
percent-level Λ. The W/Z physical readout is an open contract. The empirical record contains zero landed, discriminating,
frozen-prospective OPH hits; the program treats that sentence as the bar to
clear and prints it until a frozen prediction lands.

**The numbers, in one place.** The certified gauge-width alpha map lands at
`137.035660...` against the measured inverse fine-structure constant
`137.035999177(21)`, a 2.5-parts-per-million landing, with the map's hadronic
transport term open; the companion source map lands at `136.994835...` with
the same open term. These become physical predictions when the hadronic
transport closes. The strict W/Z lane emits the chart pair
`(80.330, 91.119) GeV` with zero target input; the physical readout contract
that would turn those chart coordinates into mass predictions is open, so no
mass accuracy or pull is claimed. Full per-row status is in **Selected
Quantitative Values** above and in the closure ledger.

**Forward tests.** A separate class of values sits within about one sigma of
measurement and is decided by named future data: the fixed-capacity theorem
forces the dark-energy equation of state $(w_0,w_a)=(-1,0)$ exactly, scored by
DESI DR3; the capacity band $\Lambda\ell_P^2\in[2.84618,2.84878]\times10^{-122}$
sits $0.03\sigma$ from Planck and separates from the uncorrected bridge at
$6.5\sigma$ once $\Lambda$ reaches percent precision; the analytic tilt
$0.9660215$ sits $0.27\sigma$ from Planck with CMB-S4-class data arriving; the
galaxy acceleration scale $1.1847\times10^{-10}\,\mathrm{m/s^2}$ sits 1.3%
from the empirical fit with a 0.485% internal discriminator between its two
readings; the black-hole ringdown comb pins offset-subtracted transition
ratios to $\ln k/\ln 2$ for every remnant; and the settled-domain predicate
puts OPH on the anomalous side of the Gaia wide-binary dispute with a full
unsuppressed boost, distinct from Newtonian gravity and from external-field
MOND alike. Each row carries a frozen decision
policy and a kill condition stated with the value. The full table, with per-row
status and registration standing, is
[docs/FORWARD_TESTS.md](docs/FORWARD_TESTS.md).

**Falsification program.** OPH runs a standing falsification program, recorded
in [OPH_FALSIFICATION_PROGRAM.md](docs/OPH_FALSIFICATION_PROGRAM.md): 33 kill
conditions grouped by domain, cryptographically frozen blind targets with
external timestamps, a preregistration queue, and a standing verdict. Failure
conditions include gauge-mediated proton decay, a fourth light generation, and
a charge-lattice outlier. Executed tests stay on that surface with their
verdicts, permanently
([STRANGE_LOOP_PRINCIPLES.md](docs/STRANGE_LOOP_PRINCIPLES.md) rule 7). The
neutrino mixing matrix and absolute masses are work in progress.

**The technical spine.** The strange-loop principles live in
[STRANGE_LOOP_PRINCIPLES.md](docs/STRANGE_LOOP_PRINCIPLES.md), the thesis and
its lineage in [STRANGE_LOOP.md](docs/STRANGE_LOOP.md), the forcing chain in
[CONSISTENCY_STACK.md](docs/CONSISTENCY_STACK.md), the step-by-step spine in
[PROOF_SPINE.md](docs/PROOF_SPINE.md), and the evidence in the closure ledger
([CLOSURE_LEDGER.md](docs/CLOSURE_LEDGER.md)). Working values for open lanes are
located from measurement and counted as borrows.

The [compact proof of OPH](extra/compact_proof_of_oph.pdf) is the shortest
complete statement of the claim lattice: the strange-loop principles, the
recovered-physics theorem legs, the fixed-point number rows with their
closure status, and the explicit failure tests. Its conclusions hold on the
declared branch hypotheses, and the closure ledger
([CLOSURE_LEDGER.md](docs/CLOSURE_LEDGER.md)) records the standing of each
number row. The decisive open computation is the blind Ward-projected hadronic
transport under a corrected successor contract. That successor freezes the
complete source method before a genuinely withheld data release, or uses an
audited clean-room operator with no target access. Historical v2 is externally
timestamped but algebraically invalid; corrective v3 is an inactive,
post-target-access scaffold. The frozen records are in
[`falsification/frozen_targets/`](falsification/frozen_targets/).

## Applications And OMEGA Hardware

OPH is also a hardware program: explicit screen microphysics turns the same
patch-consensus loop into an engineering handle on reality. A
bounded device exposes boundary data, compares records, repairs mismatch, and
locks onto stable states. OMEGA is the public hardware route into that loop:
physical chambers, labeled ports, control software, verifier records, and
repeatable records.

OPH turns screen microphysics into a way to hack reality. The target
is physical control of small patches that can be driven, measured, repaired,
and verified.

The application thesis uses machines to drive small physical patches toward the
fixed points selected by observer-patch consistency. That gives low-cost
implementation tracks for
desktop fusion energy, room-temperature OMEGA supercomputing, OMEGA-based AGI,
and local gravity or inertia control for hoverbikes and hoverboards. These are
application tracks behind evidence gates; settled-output claims belong to
verifier records and experiments. The compute claim is narrower: a
chamber-conditioned candidate distribution may reduce verifier work by a
measured lift $B=p_Q/p_U$. The classical complexity-class problem is
untouched.

Read the public applications page at
[omega.floatingpragma.io](https://omega.floatingpragma.io/). Source notes for
the application tracks live in [`APPLICATIONS.md`](docs/APPLICATIONS.md).
