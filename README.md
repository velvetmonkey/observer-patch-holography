# Observer Patch Holography (OPH)

> Observer Patch Holography starts from a simple restriction: no observer sees the whole world at once. Each observer gets only a local patch, and neighboring patches have to agree where those patches overlap. The question is how much physics can be forced from that fact alone.

**French version:** [README_FR.md](README_FR.md)

**Quick links:** [OPH Textbooks](https://learn.floatingpragma.io/) | [Reverse Engineering Reality](https://oph-book.floatingpragma.io/) | [website](https://floatingpragma.io/oph/) | [OPH Lab](https://oph-lab.floatingpragma.io)

OPH is a reconstruction program for fundamental physics. It starts from finite
observers on a finite holographic screen. Its working basis
is quantum-algebraic: patch algebras, states, trace/Born event probabilities on
declared record surfaces, and generalized entropy are part of the formal
starting point. The program is not a demand to derive every mathematical
ingredient from first principles. Its goal is to construct a consistent and
comprehensive theory of everything by using that algebraic-information basis
to recover the observed effective universe: spacetime, gauge structure,
particles, records, and observer synchronization are treated as consequences
of overlap consistency, not as primitives.

The operational claim is sharper than "information is fundamental." OPH models
reality as an observer-based fixed-point consensus process. Finite observer
patches carry local records, compare only what their overlaps expose, repair
mismatches through declared recovery moves, and settle into stable fixed points
that survive refinement. The public world is the overlap-stable output of that
process. In this sense, OPH treats reality as a computational process, not as a
static stage on which computation merely happens.

## What OPH Delivers

Most theories begin by assuming spacetime, quantum fields, and a list of
constants. OPH starts one step earlier than spacetime and quantum field theory,
with finite observers on a finite quantum-algebraic holographic screen whose
descriptions have to agree where their patches overlap. Push that requirement
hard enough and a 3+1-dimensional Lorentzian spacetime emerges, together with a
Jacobson-style Einstein equation and the realized Standard Model quotient
$SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)/\mathbb Z_6$, including the exact hypercharge lattice, the
realized color triplet $N_c=3$, and the generation count $N_g=3$. Quantum
mechanics is treated as the algebraic information language carried by the OPH
architecture. The reconstruction test is whether that basis coherently
recovers the effective universe, not whether every mathematical ingredient has
been derived from an empty starting point.
On the support-visible compact-gauge branch, the same stack derives the
four-dimensional Euclidean Yang-Mills form and identifies the Yang-Mills mass
gap exactly with the repair gap.

The mechanism is the fixed-point consensus loop. Local observers do not access
a global state from outside. They carry finite patch states, exchange
overlap-visible data, reject inconsistent continuations, and keep the stable
patterns that can be synchronized. Geometry, particles, laws, and records are
the large-scale fixed points of that observer-network computation.

The scale is set by two quantities: the total screen capacity read from the
de Sitter horizon and the local pixel ratio \(P\), the area of one screen cell
in Planck-area units. For the observed cosmological constant, the bare horizon
area ratio is about \(1.05\times10^{122}\), while the entropy capacity used by
OPH is about \(3.31\times10^{122}\). From the outside, \(P\) is a geometric
cell size slightly above the golden-ratio self-similar balance. From the
inside, it becomes the smallest electromagnetic observation scale available to
observers in the world encoded on that screen. The fine-structure lane asks for
the nonzero detuning of a holographic screen cell such that the cell's outer
geometric displacement equals the electromagnetic observation scale emitted by
the universe living on that same screen. The public solution is
\(P\simeq1.6309682094\), with
\(\alpha^{-1}(0)=137.035999177(21)\) and
\(\alpha(0)\simeq0.00729735256433\). The same fixed-point
geometry is also probed in a separate optical-cavity hardware note.

The same local pixel scale drives the gravity readout, the fine-structure
closure, gauge structure, scoped particle-mass rows, records, and observer
synchronization. The particle pipeline carries that scale into the weak sector,
the Higgs lane, selected-class quark rows, and the weighted-cycle neutrino
branch. Hadrons require either the OPH strong-binding backend or an explicitly
marked empirical hadron closure. The operating policy for those rows is in
[`HADRON.md`](HADRON.md).

### Selected Quantitative Rows

This table keeps the rows that are easiest to compare directly with PDG and
NIST values. Structural results such as the 3+1-dimensional Lorentzian spacetime, the
Standard Model quotient \(SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)/\mathbb Z_6\), the exact hypercharge
lattice, the realized color triplet \(N_c=3\), and the generation count
\(N_g=3\) live in the papers. The
quick view here sticks to direct numeric rows and exact zeros.

| Quantity | Symbol | OPH | PDG/NIST | Δ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gravitational constant | G | 6.6742999959e-11 | 6.67430(15)e-11 | 0.00003σ |
| Speed of light | c | 299792458 | 299792458 (exact) | match |
| Fine-structure (inv) | α⁻¹(0) | 137.035999177 | 137.035999177(21) | match |
| Photon mass | m_γ | 0 eV | <1e-18 eV | below bound |
| Gluon mass | m_g | 0 GeV | 0 GeV | match |
| Graviton mass | m_grav | 0 eV | <1.76e-23 eV | below bound |

**Quark sector**

| Quark | Symbol | OPH | PDG | Δ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bottom | m_b(m_b) | 4.183 GeV | 4.183 ± 0.007 | match |
| Charm | m_c(m_c) | 1.273 GeV | 1.2730 ± 0.0046 | match |
| Strange | m_s(2 GeV) | 93.5 MeV | 93.5 ± 0.8 | match |
| Down | m_d(2 GeV) | 4.70 MeV | 4.70 ± 0.07 | match |
| Up | m_u(2 GeV) | 2.16 MeV | 2.16 ± 0.07 | match |
| Top | m_t cross-section row | 172.35235532883115 GeV | 172.3523553288312 | selected-class match |

\(\Delta\) reports the sigma distance where PDG or NIST quotes a one-standard-deviation
uncertainty. Otherwise it records "match" or "below bound".

For quarks, PDG uses its standard mass conventions: `u`, `d`, and `s` at
`2 GeV`, with `c` and `b` in the `MS` scheme at their own mass scale. The
papers also carry the structural Standard Model derivations listed above and a
neutrino family, but those do not collapse to one simple PDG or NIST row and
are left out of this table.

The particle surface also reports \(W/Z\) values \(80.377\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and
\(91.18797809193725\,\mathrm{GeV}\), a Higgs value \(m_H=125.1995304097179\,\mathrm{GeV}\), and a
selected-class top value \(m_t=172.35235532883115\,\mathrm{GeV}\) using the PDG
cross-section top-mass convention. The weighted-cycle neutrino branch emits
\((0.017454720257976796, 0.019481987935919015, 0.05307522145074924)\,\mathrm{eV}\) on its
declared branch.

## Local Unification Surface

The local unification surface is organized around the public pixel ratio
\(P\simeq1.6309682094\) and one local cell area. On that surface the same scale touches the
electroweak comparison lane, the Higgs lane, the gravity-side entropy relation,
and the familiar unit readout for meters, seconds, GeV, and Kelvin. The diagram
below shows how those pieces sit on one scale. The detailed formulas and claim
tiers live in the papers.

## Status Table

The fine-structure display row uses the fixed-point value
\(\alpha^{-1}(0)=137.035999177(21)\) and
\(P\simeq1.6309682094\). The source-side audit and endpoint residual records
live in the particle paper, where they are kept separate from the public
fixed-point row.

The weak-boson pair is a validation row. Charged-lepton absolute masses are
target-anchored witness rows. The auxiliary direct-top average is a validation
row. Hadron-controlled rows use the policy in [`HADRON.md`](HADRON.md):
source-only OPH values stay separate from OPH plus empirical hadron closure
values carried by the empirical \(e^+e^-\to\mathrm{hadrons}\) payload class.

Strong CP is work in progress in the selected-class quark theorem:
the available corpus does not derive the QCD theta angle, does not emit the
physical strong-CP angle, and does not prove that the physical strong-CP phase
vanishes. The required bridge is the phase, anomaly, and topological-angle
descent on the realized branch.
