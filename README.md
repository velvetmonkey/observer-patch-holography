Observer Patch Holography (OPH) is an observer-first reconstruction program for fundamental physics. It begins with finite patches carrying local state, boundaries, records, readback, and repair moves. A public fact is one that survives when overlapping patches compare what they can see and settle into a common normal form.

The organizing equation is simple:

$$
T(\mathfrak U_{\mathrm{OPH}})=\mathfrak U_{\mathrm{OPH}}.
$$

The universe is modeled as a fixed point of its own observer-accessible readback and repair process.

## OPH For Absolute Beginners

Imagine a simulator that has no finished universe map to consult. There is no pre-drawn four-dimensional grid and no master clock outside the system. The simulator is made from many small **observer patches**. Each patch has only:

- a local state: what is happening from this patch’s perspective;
- ports or boundaries: what it can exchange with neighboring patches;
- memory: records of earlier reads;
- self-readback: the ability to inspect part of its own state;
- repair moves: ways to respond when overlapping records disagree.

This is OPH’s operational model of a subjective perspective. Every patch sees only its own finite piece of reality. “Subjective” means locally accessible, not arbitrary. Two patches that overlap must agree about the information both can inspect.

The patch-net repeatedly performs a simple computation:

```text
read local state
      ↓
exchange boundary records
      ↓
compare overlapping descriptions
      ↓
repair disagreement
      ↓
write the stable result and repeat
```

The public universe is the part that remains stable after this process. OPH calls that stable result **consensus** or a **normal form**.

The icosahedron supplies the first highly symmetric finite scaffold for this computation. It has twelve vertices, twenty triangular faces, and rotation group $A_5$. In the OPH screen model, the twelve locations become observer-facing ports, the faces organize local overlaps, and repeated refinement turns the finite scaffold into a progressively finer patch-net. The “echosahedral” language used throughout the project refers to this icosahedral observer-screen architecture.

Spacetime then appears from the computation instead of being supplied beforehand. Stable relations among patches become public adjacency, angle, and distance. The order of records inside one patch becomes local time. Synchronizable record order becomes public time. The conformal symmetry of the shared spherical screen becomes Lorentz symmetry, and the corresponding space of observer frames has three spatial dimensions.

Matter and forces are stable patterns inside the same network. A particle is a reproducible, transportable pattern in the public record structure. A gauge force describes how internal labels must transform when those patterns move between overlapping patches. Gravity describes the smooth large-scale geometry required by the shared information and entropy relations.

This is the **consciousness-first** or **observer-first** thesis in its simplest form. Conventional physics usually starts with matter fields in a four-dimensional spacetime and asks how observers or consciousness arise inside it. OPH starts with the minimal structure required for any perspective to exist at all: bounded access, self-readback, memory, comparison, and stable continuation. The shared physical world is reconstructed from the agreement conditions among those perspectives.

“Observer” is a precise structural role here. A human mind, an organism, a physical instrument, or a software process can instantiate it when it has the required local state, boundary, records, readback, and repair loop. OPH does not say that human thoughts manufacture reality. It says that a reality with no possible local perspective, record, or self-consistent readback is not yet the public physical world described by observers.

In simulation language, the universe is its own simulator. The patches, computation, records, and resulting world all belong to the same closed system. No external computer or programmer is required by the formal construction.

## Why OPH Is Interesting

OPH uses one mathematical architecture across subjects that are normally introduced separately:

- finite consensus gives stable public records and quotient normal forms;
- central record algebras give quantum event probabilities and conditional update;
- the conformal geometry of an observer screen gives the connected Lorentz group and a three-dimensional observer-frame space;
- modular flow, null transport, entropy stationarity, and small-ball geometry compose into the Einstein relation on the recovered branch;
- transportable charges and compact reconstruction give the Standard Model gauge structure;
- a finite twelve-port $A_5$ construction produces the Lie algebra
  $\mathfrak u(1)\oplus\mathfrak{su}(2)\oplus\mathfrak{su}(3)$;
- trace balance integrates this algebra to
  $S(U(3)\times U(2))\cong(SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1))/\mathbb Z_6$;
- the Minimal Admissible Realization branch selects the Standard Model charge lattice, three colors, three generations, and one Higgs doublet;
- public Lean, exact-arithmetic certificates, simulations, and executable receipts check the finite mathematical core.

The significance is the convergence. OPH does not introduce a separate mechanism for measurement, spacetime, gravity, and gauge structure. It asks how much of all four follows from the same requirement: finite observers must be able to form one stable public world.

## The Strongest Finite Result

On the declared twelve-port icosahedral branch, the permutation module splits as

$$
P_{12}\cong_{A_5}\mathbf1\oplus\mathbf3\oplus\mathbf3'\oplus\mathbf5.
$$

An explicit equivariant pullback of the block commutator then constructs

$$
(P_{12},[\ ,\ ]_\Theta)
\cong
\mathfrak u(1)\oplus\mathfrak{su}(3)\oplus\mathfrak{su}(2).
$$

This is the local Lie algebra of the Standard Model gauge forces. It is obtained from the finite coefficient geometry rather than inserted as the starting symmetry.

The same construction gives two independent appearances of the number $24$:

$$
m_{\mathrm{rep}}=2(8+3+1)=24,
$$

while the twelve screen ports have $24$ oriented slots. One count comes from the recovered gauge algebra; the other comes from the screen geometry.

## Evidence You Can Inspect

The repository contains several complementary forms of evidence:

- hand proofs in the TeX papers;
- a sorry-free 111-theorem Lean subset covering finite observer consensus and related algebraic results;
- interval and uniqueness certificates for declared numerical maps;
- finite carrier and hierarchy receipts;
- particle, geometry, dark-sector, and quantum-hardware code;
- simulations reaching more than one million patches;
- a claim registry and closure ledger connecting prose claims to artifacts.

## Research Frontier

OPH’s structural core supports several active continuations:

- quantitative particle readout and flavor transport;
- neutrino susceptibility and mixing geometry;
- record-capacity cosmology;
- dark gravity as a repair-charge condensate with dust-like and deep-galaxy regimes;
- finite Yang–Mills transfer and repair-gap constructions;
- observer-like hardware and software systems with local state, boundaries, readback, records, and repair.

These programs share the same design principle as the core theory: every proposed physical system must be represented as a bounded, self-reading patch with a public evidence bundle.

The [OPH Falsification Program](docs/OPH_FALSIFICATION_PROGRAM.md) is deliberately limited to mature mathematical and realized-branch claims. It is a verification index, not the organizing narrative of the repository.
