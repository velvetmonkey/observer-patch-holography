Lake 5.0.0-src+f72c35b

Both integration modes succeeded:

cd reverse-engineering-reality/LEAN/ObservableNormalForms

```

The full parent project also succeeded:

```text
cd reverse-engineering-reality/LEAN
lake build
Build completed successfully (8264 jobs).
```

That full build replays the pre-existing `ObserverPatchHolography` target and
therefore reports its three intentionally declared admissions in
`Primitives.lean` (`localRepair`, `Repair`, and `repair_respects_gauge`).  Those
declarations are outside this standalone artifact.  The
`ObservableNormalForms` sources themselves remain admission-free, and their
axiom audit reports no `sorryAx`.

`ObservableNormalForms/AxiomAudit.lean` was included in both builds. Its
theorem-level reports contain only the standard axioms `propext`,
`Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound` where required; several finite and exact
theorems report no axioms. No theorem reports `sorryAx`.

The source admission audit

```sh
rg -n '^\s*(sorry|admit)\b|:=\s*(sorry|admit)\b' \
  ObservableNormalForms --glob '*.lean'
```

returns no matches.
