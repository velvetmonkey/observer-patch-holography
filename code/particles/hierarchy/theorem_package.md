# Publication-Grade Theorem Package

## Theorem A: Conditional OPH electroweak hierarchy

Assume:

1. `R_P`: pixel closure branch, either public endpoint or source-audit branch with status label.
2. `Pi_U`: frozen D10 source packet.
3. `DAG_U`: no forbidden measurement path into `Phi_U`, `alpha_U`, or `v/E_star`.
4. `R_U#`: interval/Krawczyk proof record.

Then the source-side weak hierarchy is:

```math
\frac{v}{E_\star}
=
P_\star^{-1/2}
\exp\left[-\frac{2\pi}{4\alpha_U(P_\star)}\right].
```

On the public endpoint branch:

```math
v/E_\star = 2.0199803239725553\times10^{-17}.
```

On the source-audit branch:

```math
v(P_{cand})/E_\star = 2.0198114150099223\times10^{-17}.
```

## Theorem B: Higgs D10/D11 declared surface

Assume the D10/D11 input interval box `I_HT`, interval extension `F_HT#`, D11 Jacobian interval map, and `DAG_HT`.

Then:

```math
m_H=125.1995304097179\,\mathrm{GeV},\qquad
m_t^{D11}=172.3523553288312\,\mathrm{GeV}.
```

This bundle records the formula/output surface but does not include the raw interval input box.

## Corollary: OPH Higgs naturalness

The selected exact source-to-Higgs comparison map has zero RG/coarse-graining
defect:

```math
\epsilon_H =
\sup_x |H_r(\rho_{sr}n_s(x))-H_r(n_r\rho_{sr}(x))|
=0.
```

Equivalently,

```math
\epsilon_H=\max\{\epsilon^n_{sH},\epsilon^h_{sH}\}=0,\qquad
\epsilon_H\in[0,0].
```

The certificate is `issue_332_rg_naturality_certificate.json`. It allows only
the OPH source branch, the D10 source `alpha_U(P_star)` interval, the upstream
repair-tick/tick-projection/joint-stability records, and the declared D10/D11
maps. It forbids measured weak-scale, Higgs, W/Z, gravity, Planck-area, Lambda,
and tuned bare-Higgs/cutoff-counterterm inputs. Therefore the bare/counterterm
split is a regulator-coordinate split, not an observer-facing fine-tuning datum,
on the selected exact branch.

## Theorem C: Joint `(P,N_CRC)` product fixed point

Let `x=log N`. The product-separated source branch has joint space
`X=I_P x I_x` and source map

```math
\mathcal J(P,x)=(\Gamma(P),\widehat C(x)).
```

Assume the local and global component contraction certificates

```math
|\Gamma(P)-\Gamma(Q)|\le q_P|P-Q|,\qquad
|\widehat C(x)-\widehat C(y)|\le q_N|x-y|,
\qquad q_P,q_N<1.
```

In the product metric,

```math
d((P,x),(Q,y))=\max\{|P-Q|,|x-y|\},
```

the joint map is a contraction with constant `q=max(qP,qN)<1`. Banach's theorem
therefore gives a unique stable joint fixed point
`(P_star,log N_CRC)`. The theorem does not source `N_CRC` from the weak scale.
The report `certificates/R_PN_joint_fixed_point_certificate_report.json` records
the rounded capacity display and flags the weak-scale backsolve as a circular
diagnostic only.

For a genuinely coupled source map

```math
\mathcal J(P,x)=(\Gamma(P,x),\widehat C(P,x)),
```

with derivative envelope `a,b,c,d`, the coupled branch is promoted only when
there is an `r>0` such that

```math
\max\{a+b/r,d+rc\}<1.
```

Without that bound, the coupled map is residual branch freedom rather than a
theorem-grade uniqueness claim.

## Theorem D: Electroweak tick-projection bridge

The local D10 transmutation law gives

```math
\frac{v}{E_{\rm cell}}
=
\exp\left[-\frac{2\pi}{4\alpha_U(P)}\right].
```

The global repair-tick lemma gives

```math
|g_*'|=(N/\pi)^{-1/48}.
```

Define the electroweak projection exponent by

```math
\Pi_{\rm EW}(P,N)
=
\frac{-\log(v/E_{\rm cell})}{-\log |g_*'|}
=
\frac{24\pi}{\alpha_U(P)\log(N/\pi)}.
```

Since \(0<|g_*'|<1\), this exponent is unique. The target projection
`Pi_EW(P_star,N_CRC)=4P_star` is equivalent to the bridge residual

```math
B_{\rm EW}(P,N)
=
\alpha_U(P)\log(N/\pi)-\frac{6\pi}{P}
=0.
```

Equivalently, the exact bridge target is

```math
N_{\rm EW}(P)=\pi\exp\left[\frac{6\pi}{P\alpha_U(P)}\right].
```

For the public endpoint branch this gives

```math
N_{\rm EW}
=
3.5323546226929906511187512962330547600462\times10^{122}.
```

The certificate is `certificates/R_EW_tick_projection_certificate.json`. It records the exact
bridge target and the rounded-capacity diagnostic. The rounded display `3.31e122` is a
capacity-scale label and fails the exact bridge residual.

The factor `4` is the electroweak transmutation multiplicity
`\beta_EW=N_c+1=4`. The factor `48` is `2*24` from the global repair tick. Hence
`12=48/4`, and the sampling exponent is `4P_star`.

## Lemma E: Global repair-tick lemma

Setting: the cosmic record-capacity fixed point `N_CRC = F(N_CRC)` with observed-branch
readout `N_CRC = S_dS` and D6 normalization `N_CRC = pi * (r_CRC/ell_star)^2`. Coordinate:
`rho = length / r_CRC`, so the horizon sits at `rho = 1` and the local cell at
`rho_star = ell_star / r_CRC = (N_CRC/pi)^(-1/2)`.

Definition (global repair cycle): `G_N` is the scale-free (homogeneous) readback transport
attached to the fixed point. Fixed-point closure, readback without deficit or slack, means
`G_N(1) = rho_star` exactly.

Realization (closure derived from the readback interface plus a declared counting model): the
corpus defines the readback map as `F(N) = Cap_read(Obs(nf_{r,N}(U_{r,N})))` in the refinement
limit, the capacity reconstructed by the stable self-reading observer sector from the horizon
record (`paper/tex_fragments/OBSERVERS_SYNTHESIS_SECTIONS.tex`). Model `Cap_read` by the D6
area law evaluated at the effective delivery resolution `rho_read`, the canonical
scale-covariant extension of `N = pi (r/ell)^2`. The certificate records this as a declared
modeling identification. The corpus defines `Cap_read` as reconstructed capacity and does not
state this counting rule as one of its properties:

```math
F(N) = \pi / \rho_{read}^2 .
```

The fixed-point equation `N_CRC = F(N_CRC) = pi/rho_star^2` therefore forces
`rho_read = rho_star` (positive roots): deficit `rho_read > rho_star` gives `F(N) < N`, slack
`rho_read < rho_star` gives `F(N) > N`. So the closure condition `G_N(1) = rho_star` is
equivalent to the corpus fixed-point equation, and homogeneity gives

```math
G_N(\rho) = (N_{CRC}/\pi)^{-1/2}\rho.
```

On the declared 24-tick resonance branch (`G_N = g_N^{24}`, positive root) the one-tick
normal form is

```math
g_N(\rho) = (N_{CRC}/\pi)^{-1/48}\rho,
\qquad
|g_*'| = (N_{CRC}/\pi)^{-1/48}.
```

For a general `m`-tick decomposition the per-tick derivative is `(N_CRC/pi)^(-1/(2m))`;
the declared `m = 24` gives the stated `-1/48` exponent.

Boundary: the closure transport follows at the interface level of `F`, conditional on the
declared counting model above. The corpus marks the finite readback map `F_r` as schematic and
its refinement limit as conditional on existence. The remaining promotion gates are the concrete
finite-machinery verification that `nf_{r,N}` delivers a single well-defined effective
resolution, the area-law readback count at that resolution, and a representation-to-spectrum
theorem for the round count. The promoted hierarchy theorem
does not use these as inputs.

## Boundary theorem: SI gravity/clock hierarchy

The electroweak hierarchy theorem supplies `R_U`, not the full clock bridge. SI gravity requires:

```math
R_\gamma =
R_U + R_\alpha + R_e^{abs} + R_{QCD/nuc}^{133Cs} + R_{atom}^{133Cs}.
```

Only after those components are source-side and no-G DAG-certified may one use:

```math
G_{SI} =
\frac{c^5}{4\pi^2\hbar\nu_{Cs}^2}\epsilon_{Cs}^2.
```
