# OPH Hierarchy Proof Artifacts Bundle

Bundle ID: `oph-hierarchy-proof-artifacts-r1473-2026-06-13`

Generated: `2026-06-13T00:00:00Z`

This bundle packages the proof-obligation artifacts for the OPH electroweak hierarchy lane:

Status correction: all capacity "closure" language in this
historical bundle is internal to the selected bridge packet. Physical cosmic
capacity remains conditional on F and CP-1 to CP-3, and comparison with the
Lambda-located value additionally requires the joint cosmological posterior.
The 6.6 percent central-value mismatch is not an unconditional contradiction.

```math
P_\star \to \alpha_U(P_\star) \to
\frac{v}{E_\star} =
P_\star^{-1/2}\exp\left[-\frac{2\pi}{4\alpha_U(P_\star)}\right].
```

## Closure status

Closed inside this bundle:

1. The declared D10 source packet ledger.
2. The declared `DAG_U` forbidden-path check.
3. The `R_U` interval/Krawczyk inclusion witness.
4. The public and source-audit hierarchy computations.
5. The claim-tier boundary artifacts for `W/Z`, `R_HT`, `R_gamma`, and the local/global resonance.
6. The `R_N` global repair-tick theorem: under the area-law counting model the
   readback fixed-point equation is equivalent to the closure transport
   `G_N(1) = rho_star`, giving the full-cycle multiplier
   `(N_CRC/pi)^(-1/2)`. The issue-#343 representation-to-spectrum theorem
   supplies `m_rep=2*(8+3+1)=24`, hence
   `|g_*'| = (N_CRC/pi)^(-1/48)`.
7. The product-branch joint `(P,N_CRC)` fixed-point theorem: on the
   product-separated source map `J(P,x)=(Gamma(P),C_hat(x))`, component
   contraction certificates imply a unique joint branch and stability with
   `q=max(qP,qN)<1`. A genuinely coupled source map requires the recorded
   weighted-sup derivative condition.
8. The electroweak tick-projection bridge: the unique projection map is
   `Pi_EW(P,N)=24*pi/(alpha_U(P)*log(N/pi))`; the target projection
   `Pi_EW(P_star,N_CRC)=4P_star` is equivalent to
   `B_EW(P,N)=alpha_U(P)*log(N/pi)-6*pi/P=0`. The certificate records the
   exact bridge target `N_EW(P_star)` and keeps the rounded `3.31e122` capacity
   label as a diagnostic.
9. The icosahedral screen-sieve theorem: on the declared triangulated `S^2`
   screen branch, `q_v=6-deg(v)` obeys `sum_v q_v=12`; convex defect cost
   selects twelve unit fivefold defects; edge-center collars expose them as
   central ports; `A5/C5` gives the 12-vertex orbit. This supplies the
   geometric origin of the `P/12` exponent.
10. The issue-#344 conditional EW-refined bridge-capacity certificate:
   `C_EW(P,x)=(1-lambda)*x+lambda*6*pi/(P*alpha_U(P))` is a contraction at
   `lambda=1/2`; its unique fixed point gives
   `N_CRC^EW=pi*exp[6*pi/(P_star*alpha_U(P_star))]` and
   `B_EW(P_star,N_CRC^EW)=0`.
11. The issue-#342 finite readback-resolution certificate:
   the fixed-cutoff pipeline `F_r(N)=Cap_read(Obs(nf_{r,N}(U_{r,N})))`
   has one selected positive central capacity atom, so
   `rho_read(r,N)=sqrt(pi/F_r(N))` is a singleton and
   `rho_read(r,N_CRC) -> (N_CRC/pi)^(-1/2)` in the positive-root
   refinement limit.
12. The issue-#343 representation-to-spectrum round-count theorem:
   the observer-visible product adjoint has dimensions `8+3+1=12`; reversible
   write/verify orientation doubles this to `m_rep=24`. The SU(5) adjoint has
   the same single-orientation integer for the wrong support because it
   includes X/Y mixed gauge channels excluded by the product branch.
13. The RG/Higgs naturality square for the selected exact branch:
   `epsilon_H=max(epsilon_n,epsilon_h)=0`, with measured weak-scale, Higgs,
   W/Z, gravity, Planck-area, and Lambda inputs excluded.
14. The issue-#335 close-out certificate: the prerequisite records are
   accounted for and the full local/global `N_CRC` hierarchy-resonance theorem
   closes on the selected branch.
15. The issue-#331 outward-rounded interval log for the `R_U` witness:
   `certificates/R_U_outward_rounded_interval_log.json` re-evaluates the full
   `R_U` formula stack in directed-rounding IEEE-754 binary64 interval
   arithmetic (`tools/outward_interval.py`, one-ulp outward step after every
   correctly rounded primitive, in-module exp/log with explicit series
   remainder bounds, no libm exp/log assumption). The log records the
   interval image of every named formula-DAG node at both `I_U` endpoints,
   at the center, and over the full interval with the derivative enclosure,
   plus the Krawczyk inclusion `K(I_U)` strictly inside `int(I_U)` and the
   witness interval. `validators/verify_ru_outward_rounded_log.py`
   reproduces every serialized bound bit-exactly from the declared
   structural inputs (`P_fwd`, cutoffs, one-loop coefficients, seed) without
   importing measured endpoint constants, and checks that the
   high-precision root and Krawczyk image lie inside the outward-rounded
   witness.
16. The issue-#333 raw interval input box for the Higgs/top declared
   surface: `certificates/R_HT_interval_input_box_log.json` publishes the
   eleven declared branch inputs of the frozen R_HT formula stack (candidate
   D10 tuple plus declared D11 core/Jacobian constants) with centers, boxes,
   units or dimensionless normalization, and per-input provenance tags, and
   re-evaluates the full stack in the same directed-rounding backend as the
   `R_U` log (`tools/ht_formula_stack.py`, per-node interval extension
   documented in `HT_INTERVAL_EXTENSION.md`). The log records the interval
   image of every formula node at the centers and over the full box, the
   forward-mode Jacobian enclosure of `pi_y`, `pi_lambda`, `m_H`, and `m_t`
   in all eleven inputs, the diagonal chart-block non-singularity
   certificate with determinant bounded away from zero, exact rational
   inclusion of the recorded `(m_H, m_t)` decimals, and a uniqueness scope
   restricted to the declared surface (single-valued arithmetic and
   injective diagonal readout; no criticality-system existence or
   uniqueness claim). `validators/verify_ht_interval_box.py` reproduces
   every serialized bound bit-exactly, enforces the input allowlist and
   provenance classes, and scans the verify path for measured-constant
   markers. The inputs are declared branch inputs, so the enclosure closes
   the arithmetic grade of the declared surface while the source-root,
   scale, QT1--QT5, RG/scheme, rigidity, provenance, uncertainty, and
   complex-pole gates stay open upstream.
17. The pixel-screen resonance summary receipt: the selected `(P_*,N_CRC^EW)`
   branch emits `K_cell=4*N_CRC^EW/P_*`, checks
   `K_cell*(P_*/4)=N_CRC^EW`, and records the dimensionless de Sitter
   coordinate pair `Lambda_CRC*l_star^2=3*pi/N_CRC^EW` and
   `Lambda_CRC*a_cell=3*pi*P_*/N_CRC^EW=12*pi/K_cell`. This is a receipt-level
   composition of existing certificates, not a new primitive-carrier or SI
   Lambda theorem.

External/source gates outside this bundle:

1. Source-only public Thomson endpoint transport `A_T(P)`.
2. Proof-assistant formalization of the `R_U` interval witness. The
   directed-rounding outward interval log itself is supplied inside this
   bundle at `certificates/R_U_outward_rounded_interval_log.json` with
   verifier `validators/verify_ru_outward_rounded_log.py`, under the stated
   IEEE-754 assumption set; the remaining external step is a mechanized
   proof-assistant replay of that log.
3. Source derivation of the eleven declared branch inputs of the Higgs/top
   declared surface. The raw interval input box, per-node interval
   extension, Jacobian enclosure, and non-singularity certificate are
   supplied inside this bundle at
   `certificates/R_HT_interval_input_box_log.json` with verifier
   `validators/verify_ht_interval_box.py`; the remaining external step is
   source emission of the D10 tuple and the D11 core/Jacobian constants.
4. Full `R_gamma` stack for SI gravity/clock hierarchy.
5. An independently source-closed physical `E_star`; this bundle fixes
   `v/E_star`, not a weak scale in GeV.
6. The D10 QT1--QT5 quotient-path certificate: finite quotient
   canonicalization, explicit path enumeration, exact rational measures and
   central trace, fibre Gram/residual derivation, and a positive MAR gap.
7. A concrete frozen RG/matching/threshold/scheme receipt with truncation
   intervals.
8. W/Z/H complex-pole, residue, analytic-sheet, and uncertainty certificates.
9. A hash-bound prospective source DAG and branch-rigidity receipt.
10. Coupled-map extension of the joint `(P,N_CRC)` theorem, if OPH source work
   introduces cross-feedback between the local pixel and global capacity maps.
