"""Emit the global repair-tick lemma certificate.

Chain role: close the R_N-side global repair-tick lemma for the local/global
hierarchy resonance continuation without importing electroweak data.

Mathematics: the D6 screen-capacity normalization fixes the cosmic radius
ratio r_CRC/ell_star = (N_CRC/pi)^(1/2), so in the multiplicative coordinate
rho = ell/r_CRC the horizon sits at rho = 1 and the local cell at
rho_star = (N_CRC/pi)^(-1/2). The corpus readback map is
F(N) = Cap_read(Obs(nf_{r,N}(U_{r,N}))) (Observers synthesis sections,
refinement limit): the capacity reconstructed by the interior observer sector
from the horizon record. Modeling Cap_read by the D6 area law at the delivery
resolution (a declared D6-consistent identification), a readback that delivers
the record at effective resolution coordinate rho_read reconstructs
F(N) = pi / rho_read^2, so the fixed-point equation
N_CRC = F(N_CRC) = pi / rho_star^2 forces rho_read = rho_star: the readback
transport carries the horizon coordinate rho = 1 exactly to the local cell
rho_star, i.e. G_N(1) = rho_star, with full-cycle multiplier
(N_CRC/pi)^(-1/2). On the declared 24-tick resonance branch the one-tick map
is the positive homogeneous 24th root, hence |g_*'| = (N_CRC/pi)^(-1/48).
For a general m-tick decomposition the per-tick exponent is -1/(2m); the
declared m = 24 reproduces the stated exponent without correction.

Output: a machine-readable certificate for GlobalRepairTickLemma_R_N.
