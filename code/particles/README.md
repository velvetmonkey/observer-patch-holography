# OPH Particle Derivation Code

This directory is the canonical particle-spectrum code path for OPH inside
`reverse-engineering-reality`.

## Scope

The goal is to keep one auditable derivation surface from the OPH inputs
derived in the papers to the emitted particle-spectrum artifacts used by
the particle paper:

- electroweak calibration
- Higgs/top
- charged leptons
- quarks
- neutrinos
- hadrons
- public claim rendering

Historical Oracle batches, worker logs, and transient handoff material are not
part of this canonical tree.

## High-Level Chain

- electroweak calibration:
  `calibration/derive_d10_ew_observable_family.py ->
  calibration/derive_d10_ew_source_transport_pair.py ->
  calibration/derive_d10_ew_population_evaluator.py ->
  calibration/derive_d10_ew_w_anchor_neutral_shear_factorization.py ->

  hierarchy/issue_332_rg_naturality_certificate.json`
- Higgs/top:
  `calibration/derive_bw_higgs_carrier_bridge.py` records the Borel-Weil
  one-Higgs carrier bridge `H_OPH = H^0(CP1,O(1)) ~= C^2` as representation
  and group-action geometry only. The receipt distinguishes the projective
  ray's two-torus stabilizer from the nonzero vacuum vector's `U(1)_Q`
  stabilizer before the quantitative D11 lane
  `calibration/derive_d11_declared_calibration_surface.py ->
  calibration/derive_d11_forward_seed.py ->
  calibration/derive_d11_forward_seed_promotion_certificate.py ->
  calibration/derive_d11_fixed_ray_no_go_theorem.py ->
  calibration/derive_d11_live_exact_split_pair_theorem.py`
- charged leptons:
  support and scale artifacts feeding
  `leptons/derive_lepton_excitation_gap_map.py ->
  leptons/derive_lepton_log_spectrum_readout.py ->
  leptons/build_forward_charged_leptons.py`
- quarks:
  `flavor/derive_quark_sector_mean_split.py ->
  flavor/derive_quark_sector_descent.py ->
  flavor/build_forward_yukawas.py`
- neutrinos:
  `neutrino/derive_neutrino_scale_anchor.py ->
  neutrino/derive_family_response_tensor.py ->
  neutrino/derive_majorana_holonomy_lift.py ->
  neutrino/derive_majorana_phase_pullback_metric.py ->

  neutrino/build_forward_splittings.py ->
  neutrino/derive_neutrino_weighted_cycle_repair.py ->
  neutrino/derive_neutrino_bridge_rigidity_theorem.py ->
  neutrino/derive_neutrino_absolute_attachment_theorem.py ->
  neutrino/export_forward_neutrino_closure_bundle.py`
  The weighted-cycle output is a target-informed template candidate, not a
  prediction. NuFIT 6.1 rejects its correlated theta23-delta point at the
  declared 3σ gate. `neutrino/score_neutrino_nufit61.py` records the official
  profile result, and `neutrino/audit_neutrino_pmns_conventions.py` finds no
  admissible convention rescue. The bridge and absolute attachment remain
  compare-only. The shared-basis identity cancels the charged-lepton matrix by
  construction and does not supply the missing physical charged-lepton basis.
  Earlier intrinsic builders also exported left SVD vectors instead of the
  Majorana Takagi matrix; that implementation error is corrected. This lane
  emits neither a physical PMNS matrix nor absolute neutrino masses.
- hadrons:
  `qcd/derive_lambda_msbar_descendant.py ->
  hadron/derive_full_unquenched_correlator.py ->
  hadron/derive_runtime_schedule_receipt_n_therm_and_n_sep.py ->
  hadron/derive_stable_channel_cfg_source_measure_payload.py ->
  hadron/derive_stable_channel_sequence_evaluation.py ->
  hadron/derive_stable_channel_groundstate_readout.py`
- JWST compact-object source-release bridge:
  `jwst/build_compact_object_source_release_receipts.py`
  mirrors the JWST compact-object simulator claim ladder in this paper-stack
  code tree. It is diagnostic only, not a particle prediction and not an OPH
  confirmation claim.
- Fractional quotient-sector sandbox:
  `fractional/build_fractional_quotient_receipts.py`
  mirrors the fractional exciton/FQAH simulator claim ladder. It is
  diagnostic only and remains blocked at the material-specific Hamiltonian proof.
- High-energy messenger coefficient emission:
  `uhe/build_uhe_coefficient_emission_receipts.py`
  mirrors the source-only UHE coefficient-emitter receipt ladder. It freezes the
  quotient, source law, compact-engine source loads, baseline, feature map,
  moment targets, solver, no-UHE-data-use DAG, and common-source lock without
  analyzing neutrino, cosmic-ray, or gamma event data.
- Compact-transient receipt scaffold:
  `compact_transients/build_compact_transient_receipts.py`
  mirrors the compact record-surface ladder for FRBs, old-host compact
  sources, and black-hole recycling. It is diagnostic by default at
  `CR2_CONDITIONAL_PHENOMENOLOGY`, blocks physical-prediction promotion until
  control, refinement, freeze, and held-out likelihood receipts exist, and fails
  closed if a black-hole generation prior reads ringdown residuals.
- rendered public surface:
  `scripts/build_results_status_table.py`

## Conditional Candidate Values

The strict prediction ledger reports `n/a` while the sector source gates are
open. The conditional charts carry sharp numeric candidates. Each value below
holds on its stated chart and inherits the open gates recorded in
[CONDITIONAL_CANDIDATES.md](CONDITIONAL_CANDIDATES.md); none is a promoted
source-only prediction.

| Observable | Conditional value | Comparison coordinate | Condition |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `M_W` | `80.37700001539531 GeV` | stale PDG 2025 mass-dependent-width Breit--Wigner coordinate `80.3692 +- 0.0133 GeV` | D10 chart value, conditional on the unemitted QT1--QT5 certificate; no map to the comparison convention and no physical residual or pull |
| `M_Z` | `91.18797807794321 GeV` | stale PDG 2025 mass-dependent-width Breit--Wigner coordinate `91.1880 +- 0.0020 GeV` | same incomplete value-law chart; no map to the comparison convention and no physical residual or pull |
| `M_W / M_Z` | `0.8814429457652062` | ratio formed from the stale Breit--Wigner coordinates, `0.8813572` | scale-free coordinate of the same quintet, but not a scheme-independent pole observable |
| `sin^2 theta_W_eff` | `0.22305833336075578` | `0.22321` in a distinct on-shell comparison convention | same incomplete quintet; no common scheme map, so no residual or pull |
| `m_H` | `125.1995304097179 GeV` | `125.13 +- 0.11 GeV` | target-anchored fit: the synchronization scale minimizes an objective containing the measured pair; validation of the formula stack, never a prediction |
| `m_t` | `172.3523553288312 GeV` | `172.1 +- 0.6 GeV` | companion coordinate of the same target-anchored fit |
| `m_t` (criticality, adopted branch) | `172.629 GeV` | `172.60 +- 0.27 GeV` | double-criticality boundary at the log-midpoint anchor `E_star exp(-pi) P^(-1/6)`, two loops; boundary-scale selection is a theorem modulo two carrier facts CF1/CF2 |
| `m_H` (criticality, adopted branch) | `125.771 GeV` | `125.13 +- 0.11 GeV` | same branch and gates; tree readout inside the declared matching band |
| `m_H` at measured `m_t` (relation test) | `125.72 GeV` | `125.13 +- 0.11 GeV` | fit-free curve of the criticality family; tests the m_t to m_H relation independently of the boundary-scale selection |
| `M_W`, `M_Z` (strict source-audit branch) | `80.3301, 91.1191 GeV` | stale Breit--Wigner coordinates `80.3692, 91.1880 GeV` | zero-selector chart on the source branch; the renormalized-vev, tadpole, threshold, running, finite-order, uncertainty, and complex-pole maps are open, so this row is not a physical mass comparison |
| `m_e, m_mu, m_tau` (MCPR conditional) | `0.510956, 105.649, 1776.78 MeV` | `0.51100, 105.658, 1776.93 MeV` | declared MCPR response architecture (84 ppm coherent offset); source-only completion is the A5/W5 orbit program |
| `m_b, m_s, m_d` (Clebsch lane) | `6.03 GeV, 140 MeV, 6.1 MeV` | `4.18 GeV, 93.5 MeV, 4.7 MeV` | conditional on MCPR leptons and the register Clebsch pattern (1, 1/3, 3); ratios and the Cabibbo angle land at the ten-percent scale, normalization carries the named third-generation tension |
| `theta_C` (Gatto-Sartori-Tonin) | `0.2086` | `0.2250` | same Clebsch lane; `sqrt(m_d/m_s)` |
| `Lambda_QCD^(3)` | `0.3348 GeV [0.319, 0.350]` | `0.338 +- 0.012 GeV (published)` | dimensional transmutation of the source strong coupling; declared threshold inputs bracket-swept |
| `m_N` (nucleon) | `0.929 GeV [0.823, 1.043]` | `0.9383 GeV` | source `Lambda_QCD` times a published lattice-theory ratio (`oph_plus_external_qcd_theory`) |
| `alpha^-1` (root plus public width diagnostic) | `137.035959513608567790...` | `137.035999177` | certified source root plus `alpha_U(P_public)`; physical Thomson transport is work in progress |
| `v / E_star` | `2.0199803239725553e-17` | dimensionless | public-endpoint hierarchy packet; the physical normalization of `E_star` is work in progress |

The source-root-plus-public-width diagnostic is not a fixed point of one map.
Its difference from the measured endpoint is
`0.00003966339143220971057` (`2.8943775118e-7` relative). The certified
self-consistent gauge-width fixed point is
`alpha^-1 = 137.035660136946577...` (CL-2 residual `2.5e-6` relative, about
`1.6e4` measurement sigma), and the certified source root is
`alpha^-1 = 136.994835177412937295...`; the physical Thomson map is work in
progress (see
`../../docs/CLOSURE_LEDGER.md`).

The per-family surface with tier labels, explanations, and blocking objects is
[SOURCE_ONLY_MASS_PREDICTIONS.md](SOURCE_ONLY_MASS_PREDICTIONS.md), generated by
`scripts/build_source_only_mass_prediction_surface.py`.

The W/Z lane has three distinct numeric surfaces:

- the selected-carrier chart emits
  `80.38629169244275 GeV` and `91.18290444674243 GeV`;
- the archived D10 value-law candidate emits
  `80.37700001539531 GeV` and `91.18797807794321 GeV`;
- the frozen `80.377 GeV`, `91.18797809193725 GeV` pair is a
  comparison-only adapter.

The archived value law is an exact implication of the QT1--QT5 quotient-path
certificate. The repository does not emit that certificate. A proof-producing
enumeration must construct the quotient canonicalizer and finite path lists,
verify the incidence counts, exact color weighting convention, a
representation-derived `Z_6` invariant-rank fraction (not merely group order),
the fibre Gram form and residual pairing, and prove a
positive MAR gap over an explicit deformation class. The executable QT receipt
checks only the downstream algebra and chart Jacobian; it fails closed on every
source-entailment field.

The Higgs/top lane carries two distinct surfaces. The declared calibration
surface emits `m_H = 125.1995304097179 GeV` and `m_t = 172.3523553288312 GeV`
by back-solving from the measured pair through the synchronization-scale
scan; those values are target-anchored fits. The criticality surface derives
both Yukawa-sector boundaries from the gauge sector through the
double-criticality law (`lambda = 0` and `beta_lambda = 0` at one source
scale) and is a zero-continuous-parameter family over the boundary scale:
the archived `mu_U` branch gives `(164.1, 115.1) GeV` at one loop, the named
source scales bracket the measured pair at both loop orders, and the
fit-free curve reproduces `m_H = 125.72 GeV` at the measured top. The
boundary-scale selection is a theorem modulo two finite carrier facts. A
variational principle (AR1 the boundary reconciles the two anchor records at
`mu_U` and `E_cell`; AR2 the reconciliation cost is quadratic in RG time; AR3
the anchors have equal capacity) proves the unique minimizer
`E_star exp(-pi) P^(-1/6)`, `(m_t, m_H) = (172.63, 125.77)` at two loops
(`runs/calibration/d11_boundary_scale_midpoint_selection_theorem.json`). AR2 is
discharged under the canonical Gaussian-MaxEnt record model, the AR1 placement
follows from port-additivity plus repair minimization, and AR3 reduces to the
carrier facts CF1 (the boundary record has exactly two parent ports,
gauge-unification and transmutation) and CF2 (those registers are the same
class at equal refinement depth); given `RM and CF1 and CF2` the axioms force
the scale with no remaining choices, and CF1/CF2 are the same D11 census
certificate the W/Z law needs
(`runs/calibration/d11_anchor_reconciliation_reduction_theorems.json`). The
flow-internal selection route is closed by a no-go
(`runs/calibration/d11_boundary_scale_selection_audit.json`); AR3 is measurable
and the three-loop implied scale is the registered discriminating test.
The row is not a strict source-only particle prediction. Its inherited gates
include the final source root, an independently physical `E_star`, QT1--QT5,
the concrete RG/matching/scheme receipt, the DS1--DS5 D11 split-character and
rigidity certificate, and top-threshold
control, a complex-pole/uncertainty certificate, and a prospective source DAG.
The full proof-producing implementation contract is documented in
[`calibration/WZH_SOURCE_CLOSURE_CAMPAIGN.md`](calibration/WZH_SOURCE_CLOSURE_CAMPAIGN.md).
The exact public running-top row uses the PDG 2025 cross-section entry
`Q007TP4`.
The auxiliary direct-top average `Q007TP` is compare-only; #207 is closed as a
corpus-limited codomain no-go.

The hierarchy proof bundle is a separate audit lane from the rounded `1.63094`
calibration carrier. It records the public endpoint branch
`P_C = 1.630968209403959324879279847782648941`,
`alpha_U(P_C) = 0.041124336195630495`, and
`v/E_star = 2.0199803239725553e-17`, together with a source-audit branch that
keeps the public Thomson endpoint out of the upstream solve. Its Krawczyk
certificate proves a unique source zero for the declared `R_U` formula stack
inside the supplied interval. The local/global bridge closes on the exact
capacity value
`N_CRC^EW = 3.5323546226929906511187512962330547600462e122`,
with zero bridge residual, the 12-port screen sieve, the 24-slot oriented
repair register, and `epsilon_H = 0` on the selected source-to-Higgs branch.
The screen factor is conditional on strict unit splitting, inverse pairing,
and a source-side D-optimal tomography selector whose production is work in
progress. These are dimensionless hierarchy/naturality statements. They do not turn
`v/E_star` into a GeV mass until the physical meaning and normalization of
`E_star` are independently source-closed.
The pixel-screen receipt records the same selected `(P_*,N_CRC^EW)` pair as an
equal-area screen chart:
`K_cell = 4*N_CRC^EW/P_*`,
`K_cell*(P_*/4)=N_CRC^EW`,
`Lambda_CRC*l_star^2=3*pi/N_CRC^EW`, and
`Lambda_CRC*a_cell=3*pi*P_*/N_CRC^EW=12*pi/K_cell`.
It is a summary receipt of the existing certificates, not an SI Lambda or
primitive-carrier promotion.
Full SI gravity remains gated by the no-G clock stack.

## CL-5 Electroweak Status

The emitted W/Z pair is a running/tree chart coordinate. A complete physical
observable, renormalization prescription, theory uncertainty, and complex-pole
map are absent. CL-5 is not evaluable and is outside the falsification program.

These artifacts fix the quark claim boundary on the local code surface. After
all target rows, exact target witnesses, fitted spreads, and residuals against
them are removed, the source equations determine two ordered profile rays but
leave their endpoint spans independent. The compatible spread fiber is exactly
`(R_{>0})^2`. Its free rescaling action preserves the source identities and
changes the affine mass readout, so it is a physical non-identifiability rather
than a gauge redundancy. The selected-class descent proves representative
independence only after a spread datum is attached; it does not select the
datum. The edge-statistics candidate also leaves two unfixed correction
coefficients and begins from a hand-written family-kernel template.

The stronger no-extra-axiom result is emitted in
[`quark_axiom_level_yukawa_moduli_nonidentifiability.json`](runs/flavor/quark_axiom_level_yukawa_moduli_nonidentifiability.json).
MAR orders the structural tuple `(chi_cpl, N_nonab, N_c, N_g)` and contains no
Yukawa eigenvalue coordinate. Independent positive rescalings of the two
centered quark profiles therefore remain physically distinct equal-score MAR
minima. The positive family has no smallest member, so MAR cannot be read as a
hidden numerical Yukawa selector under its stated definition.

The same-family and common-refinement artifacts reproduce their chosen target
coordinates after target inversion. They are audit surfaces, not source-only
predictions. Their packet combines light-quark `MSbar` coordinates at 2 GeV,
charm and bottom `MSbar` coordinates at self-scale, and a separate top pole
extraction. The stored GeV-valued matrices therefore certify mass textures,
not physical dimensionless Yukawa matrices. A physical Yukawa construction
would require source-emitted RG trajectories, common-scale transport with
threshold matching, a top conversion, the running Higgs expectation value in
the same scheme, and `y_q(mu) = sqrt(2) m_q(mu) / v(mu)`. Numeric public quark
rows remain withheld. Reopening the source theorem requires a new OPH source
observable that breaks the independent positive-rescaling action without a
dependency path to target data.
