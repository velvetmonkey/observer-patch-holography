# V1 Protocol Erratum

Date: 2026-07-16

This erratum supersedes the historical V1 scoring procedure. It does not
rewrite the frozen v2 target or the historical runtime artifact.

Immutable records:

- `falsification/frozen_targets/hadronic_closure_target_2026-07-14_v2.json`
  has SHA-256
  `8dcefe93f124e21295b8e7cd85f2524ab17c65ad003c4fdac6205213d03ac6b2`.
- `runtime/ward_projected_payload_bracket_current.json` has SHA-256
  `395b1b6bc3d53ec40222e03004cced920236da3ed3b3e46cd407e71ab4852a15`.

## Historical V1 Disposition

Historical V1 cannot be promoted. Six independent defects force that
disposition:

1. `run_bracket.py` contained target constants and a comparison tolerance.
2. The directing session had read target-side canon values.
3. The emitter evaluated the internal root
   `P = 1.630972095858897...`, while v2 declares
   `P = 1.630968209403959...`.
4. The old scoring text compared an emitted `Delta_source` total near 7 to 10
   with a residual coordinate near 0.041. Its S containment used the intended
   S coordinate, but the artifact remained a sampled grid envelope rather than
   a point payload or interval certificate.
5. V2 assigned one scalar source target to CL-1 and CL-2, although CL-2 adds
   `alpha_U(P)` and therefore requires a different source total.
6. The purported hadronic target silently treated the open electroweak
   remainder as zero, conflating `S_QEW_effective` with `S_hadronic`.

Numerical containment does not cure source contamination, coordinate
conflation, or an evaluation-point mismatch. The old artifact remains an
exploratory engineering record.

## Corrective Machine Contract

`falsification/frozen_targets/hadronic_closure_target_2026-07-16_v3.json`
is the corrective contract for future evaluation. It is not a retroactive
target and is explicitly marked
`corrective_contract_not_yet_externally_timestamped_not_scorable`.

It corrects more than the total-versus-residual type error:

- `Delta_source_total` and
  `Delta_source_residual_vs_implemented` are different coordinate kinds. A
  residual is diagnostic and cannot substitute for a total.
- `S_QEW_effective = (Delta_hadronic + Delta_EW) / Delta_quark_naive` and
  `S_hadronic = Delta_hadronic / Delta_quark_naive` are different coordinate
  kinds while `Delta_EW = 0` remains unproved.
- CL-1 and CL-2 have independent completed maps. CL-2 adds `alpha_U(P)`, so
  one scalar target cannot close both rows.
- Point values in v3 are diagnostics only. An eligible payload must be a
  target-blind function or a certified interval enclosure over the registered
  P basin, with numerical and theory errors and a derivative or Lipschitz
  bound.
- A sampled grid's extrema are not an interval certificate.

V3 permits no promotion or falsification until a successor is externally
timestamped and activated before any eligible payload work begins. Historical
V1 predates the correction and remains permanently non-promotable.

## Repaired Process Boundary

The source process and comparison process are separate:

1. Place only source code and allowed source-side inputs in the emitter
   environment. Exclude `falsification/`, prior score files, and target-bearing
   prose.
2. Run `run_bracket.py` at its source-derived internal Stage-5 P. The program
   has no P override and rejects a measurement-located or target-supplied P.
   Its output is an uncertified singleton diagnostic, not an eligible closure
   payload.
3. Seal both the file hash and its embedded
   `content_sha256` before comparison.
4. Transfer the sealed artifact to a separate scorer environment.
5. Run `score_bracket.py` with the sealed artifact and corrective v3. Today it
   returns `NOT_EVALUABLE` with a nonzero status because v3 is inactive. Even
   under a future activated contract, the current singleton grid fails the
   certification gate.
6. Do not convert point-diagnostic containment into a verdict. A future scorer
   must solve and interval-certify CL-1 and CL-2 independently.

Example source emission:

```bash
python3 run_bracket.py --output /sealed/source-bracket.json
```

Example separate scoring step:

```bash
python3 score_bracket.py \
  /sealed/source-bracket.json \
  ../../../../falsification/frozen_targets/hadronic_closure_target_2026-07-16_v3.json \
  --output /sealed/source-bracket-score.json
```

The expected current result is `NOT_EVALUABLE`; there is no successful scalar
score. Future eligibility requires a newly frozen target version, an external
timestamp preceding payload work, a clean target-free dependency cone, the
full receipt set named by v3, a certified P-domain source object, a closed
`Delta_EW` gate, and separate completed-map interval solves.
