"""Real lattice QCD engine, diagnostic scale, for the OPH hadron lane.

Quenched SU(3) gauge generation, clover-Wilson valence propagators, pion and
nucleon correlators, and a two-flavor pseudofermion HMC branch. Every number
this package emits is computed from the lattice dynamics; nothing is anchored
to target masses. Its output class is diagnostic and non-promoting: the #425
production closure additionally requires HPC-scale ensembles and the full
systematics program, which no local run can supply.
