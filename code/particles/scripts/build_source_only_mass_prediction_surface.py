"""Build the per-family source-only mass prediction surface.

This status surface collects, for every particle family, the strongest
numerical mass coordinate the corpus emits, its claim tier, and the named
objects that block the next tier.  It reads generated lane artifacts and
writes one JSON artifact plus the repository document
``SOURCE_ONLY_MASS_PREDICTIONS.md``.

Tier ladder used by every row:

- T0 comparison-only: measured value or target-anchored postdiction; never an
  ancestor of a prediction.
- T1 empirical closure: OPH structure plus a declared empirical transport
  packet; certified intervals.
- T2 declared-model conditional: source coordinates propagated through a
  declared architecture whose selection is unproved.
- T3 source-only dimensionless: unique consequence of the source records plus
  proved selection theorems.
- T4 source-only absolute: T3 plus a closed operational clock ratio.

GeV and MeV displays that use the unclosed clock candidate inherit its
calibration-checksum status and are annotated per row.  This builder reads no
measured particle mass.
