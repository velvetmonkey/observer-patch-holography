# Exact Fits Only

Generated: `2026-06-29T07:33:23Z`

This surface lists exact target matches on declared OPH carriers. It separates theorem-grade selected-class outputs from compare-only and carrier-restricted exact surfaces.
For quarks, the selected-class theorem and its supporting exact carriers coincide with the official PDG 2025 API running-quark target surface.

## Higgs/Top Reference Exact Adapter

- Fit kind: `exact_target_anchored_compare_only_inverse_slice`
- Scope: `compare_only_inverse_slice`
- Promotable: `false`
- Source artifact: `code/particles/runs/calibration/d11_reference_exact_adapter.json`
- Max absolute residual: `0.0`
- Note: Exact only as a compare-only inverse slice on the D11 Jacobian. The live D11 theorem lane uses a conditional split candidate on the declared D10/D11 surface. That surface emits `m_H = 125.1995304097179 GeV` and a companion top coordinate `m_t = 172.3523553288312 GeV`, but strict promotion is blocked until the D10 target-free repair closes. The target-anchored selected-class running-top witness uses the PDG 2025 cross-section entry `Q007TP4`, but it is audit-only under the strict public-output policy. The auxiliary direct-top average `Q007TP` is compare-only; [#207](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/207) is closed as a corpus-limited no-go by `code/particles/runs/calibration/direct_top_bridge_contract.json`.

## Charged Current-Family Exact Witness

- Fit kind: `exact_target_anchored_current_family_witness`
- Scope: `current_family_only`
- Promotable: `false`
- Source artifact: `code/particles/runs/leptons/lepton_current_family_exact_readout.json`
- Max absolute residual: `1.1102230246251565e-15`
- Note: Exact on the ordered charged eigenvalue triple, with a closed ordered-three-point readout theorem inside `current_family_only`, and with the scoped affine coordinate `A_ch_current_family` closed on that same exact family. The charged theorem lane does not emit a theorem-grade absolute anchor; [#201](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/201) is closed as a corpus-limited no-go by `code/particles/runs/leptons/charged_end_to_end_impossibility_theorem.json`.

## Quark Current-Family Exact Witness

- Fit kind: `exact_target_anchored_current_family_witness`
- Scope: `current_family_only`
- Promotable: `false`
- Source artifact: `code/particles/runs/flavor/quark_current_family_exact_readout.json`
- Max absolute residual: `1.1368683772161603e-13`
- Note: Exact on the official PDG 2025 API running-quark target surface on the ordered three-point quark family witness, with the internal same-family quadratic readout closed on the fixed carrier and the selected-sheet exact closure packaged on `sigma_ref`. The top coordinate uses PDG summary `Q007TP4`. The auxiliary direct-top entry `Q007TP` is compare-only; [#207](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/207) is closed as a corpus-limited no-go. The declared scope is `current_family_only`. A separate restricted theorem chain emits a sector-attached `Sigma_ud^phys` element on the explicit `current_family_common_refinement_transport_frame_only` carrier, and the merged transport-frame theorem reconstructs the same running sextet exactly on `current_family_common_refinement_transport_frame_only`. The declared transport-frame chain also closes explicit exact forward Yukawas `Y_u` and `Y_d` with certification status `forward_matrix_certified`, and the full declared-carrier chain is recorded in `oph_quark_current_family_end_to_end_exact_pdg_derivation_chain`. A separate target-free mass bridge closes `Delta_ud_overlap = (1/6) * log(c_d / c_u)`, equivalently `quark_d12_t1_value_law`, on the emitted D12 ray. A separate public theorem closes on the selected public physical quark frame class chosen by `P`: `oph_quark_public_physical_sigma_datum_descent` makes the exact physical sigma datum target-free public on that selected class, and `oph_quark_public_exact_yukawa_end_to_end_theorem` emits the same exact sextet together with explicit exact forward Yukawas `Y_u` and `Y_d`. This entry remains an exact-fit surface rather than that public selected-class theorem.

## Quark Selected-Class Exact Theorem

- Fit kind: `selected_class_target_anchored_exact_witness`
- Scope: `selected_public_physical_quark_frame_class_only_but_sigma_datum_target_derived`
- Promotable: `false`
- Source artifact: `code/particles/runs/flavor/quark_public_exact_yukawa_end_to_end_theorem.json`
- Max absolute residual: `5.684341886080802e-14`
- Note: Selected-class exact witness on the public physical quark frame class chosen by `P`; strict promotion is blocked because the sigma datum is target-derived. `oph_quark_public_physical_sigma_datum_descent` makes the exact physical sigma datum target-free public on that selected class, and `oph_quark_public_exact_yukawa_end_to_end_theorem` emits the exact PDG 2025 running-quark sextet together with explicit exact forward Yukawas `Y_u` and `Y_d`. The top coordinate uses PDG summary `Q007TP4`. The auxiliary direct-top entry `Q007TP` is compare-only; [#207](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/207) is closed as a corpus-limited no-go by `code/particles/runs/calibration/direct_top_bridge_contract.json`. This is selected-class closure only. It does not claim a global classification of all quark frame classes.

## Neutrino Two-Parameter Exact Adapter

- Fit kind: `exact_two_observable_compare_only_segment_adapter`
- Scope: `compare_only_two_parameter_segment_adapter`
- Promotable: `false`
- Source artifact: `code/particles/runs/neutrino/neutrino_two_parameter_exact_adapter.json`
- Max absolute residual: `4.0657581468206416e-20`
- Note: Exact compare-only fit to both representative PDG central splittings by moving along the explicit positive selector segment and then rescaling with one positive `lambda_nu`. It is diagnostic-only after the emitted weighted-cycle bridge-rigidity and absolute-attachment theorems. On that same exact compare-only branch, the explicit bridge coordinates are `B_nu = 6.69675975` and `C_nu = 0.99952948`, but they remain sidecars and must not feed back into theorem state.

## Neutrino Atmospheric Only Exact Adapter

- Fit kind: `exact_single_observable_compare_only_adapter`

- Promotable: `false`
- Source artifact: `code/particles/runs/neutrino/neutrino_compare_only_scale_fit.json`
- Exact matched observable: `Delta m32^2`
- Note: Exact only for one splitting observable on the repaired weighted-cycle family. The same artifact states that no single `lambda_nu` hits both central splittings exactly.
