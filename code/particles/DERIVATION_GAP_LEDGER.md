## Bundle Claim Gates

Claim gates are grouped into coupled closure packets rather than a one-blocker-at-a-time queue.

| Bundle | Claim label | Gaps | Promotion question |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `electroweak-root-closure-bundle` | `endpoint_package_closed_source_measure_payload_absent` | `pclosure.compressed-trunk-artifact`, `d10.ward-projected-thomson-endpoint`, `d10.source-residual-map-and-interval-certificate`, `d10.rg-matching-threshold-scheme`, `d10.same-scheme-anchor-bridge`, `pclosure.certified-codepath-adoption` | Can one source-emitted map Delta_Th(P), with declared matching and interval bounds, certify the compressed P trunk as the particle root without importing alpha(0)? |
| `spectrum-source-bundle` | `closed_corpus_limited_source_boundaries_emitted` | `charged.determinant-normalization-transport`, `quark.source-spread-identifiability`, `quark.running-scheme-and-yukawa-normalization`, `quark.selected-class-vs-global-classification`, `neutrino.pmns-status-and-absolute-rows` | Is there one OPH excitation dictionary and sector-isolated trace-lift theorem that explains the charged affine anchor and breaks the quark two-modulus spread action while also deriving a source-closed neutrino operator, charged basis, and mass-label rule without target fitting? |
| `strong-cp-closure-bundle` | `open_physical_invariant_gap` | `qcd.strong-cp-angle` | Can a source-only common-scale quark mass matrix be extended to the physical strong-CP invariant, including theta_QCD, bar(theta), and a vanishing theorem on the realized branch? |
| `qcd-thomson-backend-bundle` | `source_backend_boundary_empirical_policy_emitted` | `d10.ward-projected-thomson-endpoint`, `hadron.production-backend-systematics`, `hadron.empirical-ee-spectral-closure` | Can the source-only backend or the empirical e+e- spectral payload supply the Ward-projected hadronic term needed by the Thomson endpoint with row class recorded? |
| `top-codomain-bridge-bundle` | `closed_corpus_limited_codomain_no_go` | `calibration.direct-top-bridge` | Can the cross-section target-audit top coordinate be mapped into the auxiliary direct-top extraction codomain without using Q007TP as a calibration input? |
| `particle-root-integration-gate` | `keep_candidate_with_constructive_next_artifacts` | `pclosure.compressed-trunk-artifact`, `d10.ward-projected-thomson-endpoint`, `d10.rg-matching-threshold-scheme`, `pclosure.certified-codepath-adoption`, `charged.determinant-normalization-transport`, `quark.source-spread-identifiability`, `quark.running-scheme-and-yukawa-normalization`, `quark.selected-class-vs-global-classification`, `neutrino.pmns-status-and-absolute-rows`, `calibration.direct-top-bridge`, `hadron.production-backend-systematics`, `hadron.empirical-ee-spectral-closure` | Do the returned packets jointly close the endpoint, matching, interval, and source-object requirements strongly enough to promote the compressed trunk into particle builders? |

## Bundle Packet Results

- `electroweak-root-closure-bundle`: `endpoint_package_closed_source_measure_payload_absent`. Constructive result. The admissible endpoint object is explicit and the endpoint package computes the residual inverse-alpha packet. The source-spectral reduction theorem is emitted. Delta_Th(P) must split into source lepton transport, a Ward-projected hadronic spectral density rho_had(s;P), a certified electroweak/scheme remainder, RG/matching certificates, quadrature bounds, and an interval-level fixed-point certificate. The local implementation targets are P_derivation/runtime/thomson_endpoint_contract_current.json and P_derivation/runtime/source_spectral_theorem_current.json.
- `spectrum-source-bundle`: `closed_corpus_limited_source_boundaries_emitted`. No promotion. Charged leptons are closed as a corpus-limited no-go by the end-to-end impossibility theorem: the same-family witness and conditional algebraic readout remain, but no theorem-grade A_ch(P) is emitted. The quark source fiber retains two free positive spread moduli, its running-coordinate chart is conventional, and its GeV matrices are mass textures. Selected-fiber descent and the global-classification no-go do not change those facts. The weighted-cycle neutrino point is a rejected target-informed candidate; no physical PMNS, ordering, Majorana, or absolute-mass row is emitted.
- `strong-cp-closure-bundle`: `open_physical_invariant_gap`. No promotion. The selected-class quark wrapper carries only target-anchored mixed-scheme mass textures. The source spread pair is non-identifiable and the physical dimensionless Yukawa normalization is absent. The available corpus does not emit the determinant-line phase contribution, the bare theta_QCD term, or a theorem forcing the physical strong-CP phase to vanish.
- `qcd-thomson-backend-bundle`: `source_backend_boundary_empirical_policy_emitted`. Constructive result with two surfaces. The source-only primitive remains production_ward_projected_hadronic_spectral_measure_export and requires a real OPH hadron backend. The empirical surface uses a separate e+e- payload class and cannot promote the source-only theorem.
- `top-codomain-bridge-bundle`: `closed_corpus_limited_codomain_no_go`. No-go result. Q007TP4 remains a target-audit coordinate. The auxiliary direct-top row Q007TP is compare-only because the available corpus emits no source-side extraction-response kernel into that codomain.
- `particle-root-integration-gate`: `keep_candidate_with_constructive_next_artifacts`. No promotion. The bundle run emits constructive next artifacts, so the compressed P trunk remains candidate/audit metadata until those artifacts are populated and certified.

## Claim Gates

| ID | Lane | Claim label | Gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pclosure.compressed-trunk-artifact` | P closure | `closed_canonical_guarded_candidate_artifact` | Keep emitting p_closure_trunk_current.json and block live prediction promotion. |
| `d10.ward-projected-thomson-endpoint` | D10 electromagnetic endpoint | `closed_blocker_isolated_endpoint_package` | Keep the package as the closed blocker-isolation artifact for issue #223. |
| `d10.source-residual-map-and-interval-certificate` | D10 electromagnetic endpoint | `closed_blocker_isolated_source_residual_no_go` | Populate the Ward-projected source spectral measure payload, including rho_had(s;P) or an equivalent spectral primitive, matching remainder, certified quadrature bounds, and the interval certificate for the final map. |
| `d10.rg-matching-threshold-scheme` | D10 running and matching | `closed_declared_convention_contract` | Keep the declared-convention status visible in prediction surfaces and require a separate theorem before treating those conventions as OPH-derived. |
| `pclosure.certified-codepath-adoption` | P closure | `closed_guarded_codepath_adoption` | Switch live particle builders only after the source spectral measure payload emits R_Q(P), the interval certificate proves the full map, and the compressed trunk is promoted beyond guarded candidate metadata. |
| `charged.determinant-normalization-transport` | Charged leptons | `closed_corpus_limited_charged_end_to_end_no_go` | Keep charged masses suppressed. Under the no-new-axiom rule, reopen only if an already-declared determinant-sensitive source observable is exhibited that breaks the kappa countermodel; the gate still flips only when N_det has the certified singleton interval [0,0]. |
| `quark.source-spread-identifiability` | Quarks | `closed_corpus_limited_two_modulus_nonidentifiability_obstruction` | Keep all numeric quark rows suppressed. With additional axioms excluded, reopen only if a theorem from the existing MaxEnt/refinement data refutes the equal-MAR-score counterfamily and emits both spreads. |
| `quark.running-scheme-and-yukawa-normalization` | Quarks | `closed_structural_scheme_nonidentifiability_obstruction` | Emit an RG-covariant mass trajectory or invariant. Apply a declared comparison chart afterward, and require one common scale, threshold transport, top conversion, running v(mu), and y=sqrt(2)m/v before using the phrase physical Yukawa matrix. |
| `quark.selected-class-vs-global-classification` | Quarks | `selected_class_descent_closed_global_classification_no_go` | Keep selected-fiber descent scoped to representative independence. Global classification may reopen only for a source-emitted ambient public-frame classifier; numeric mass promotion is governed by the separate spread and scheme obstructions. |
| `neutrino.pmns-status-and-absolute-rows` | Neutrinos | `rejected_candidate_source_basis_and_kernel_open` | Derive a source-closed neutrino operator, stable physical charged-lepton left basis, and mass-eigenstate label/order rule without oscillation-target feedback; freeze that construction before evaluating a later likelihood. Keep all present weighted-cycle, bridge, and exact-adapter numbers rejected or compare-only. |
| `qcd.strong-cp-angle` | Strong CP | `open_theta_qcd_bar_theta_vanishing_gap` | Keep strong CP explicit as an open branch. First emit a source-only quark mass matrix at one declared scale with physical determinant-line phase data. Then fix the topological-angle contribution and prove that the anomaly-invariant strong-CP phase vanishes. |
| `calibration.direct-top-bridge` | D11/top codomain | `closed_corpus_limited_codomain_no_go` | Keep both top coordinates compare-only. Reopen only for a concrete source-side extraction-response kernel. |
| `hadron.production-backend-systematics` | Hadrons | `source_backend_absent_empirical_policy_emitted` | Keep source-only hadron rows suppressed. Use empirical hadron closure rows only through the documented e+e- spectral payload. Promote source-only hadron rows only after a working OPH hadron backend emits production hadron output, Ward-projected spectral data, and systematics. |
| `hadron.empirical-ee-spectral-closure` | Hadrons | `payload_populated_endpoint_evaluated_gap_anchor_localized` | Emit the source-side electroweak scheme bridge for a0(P) that produces the certified anchor-gap interval; refine the payload with experiment-level tables when a finer compilation is ingested. |
| `d10.repair-tuple-selection` | D10/D11 electroweak masses | `conditional_selection_theorem_axioms_named` | Derive the descent axioms A2 and A3 from the realized carrier package (the color-singlet projection weight and the coherent neutral color sum), which closes the selection unconditionally and unblocks the D10 promotion review. |
| `d10.same-scheme-anchor-bridge` | P closure / D10 electromagnetic endpoint | `structure_resolved_reduces_to_source_hadron_backend` | A source-only anchor bridge reduces to the OPH hadronic spectral measure, blocked on the hadron backend (#425). No source-only scheme-bridge theorem exists on the current corpus; #545 stays open as that reduction. The empirical-class bridge is the built payload/endpoint pair. |

## Claim Policy

- The compressed P trunk is an audit/candidate artifact until the endpoint and certificate gates close.
- Claim gates are handled as coupled bundles rather than isolated one-off fixes.
- The particle pipeline must keep compare-only, continuation, selected-class, and theorem-grade rows mechanically distinct.
- Golden-ratio torus or resonance language is not a derivation input unless a separate representation-to-spectrum theorem is supplied.
