# Charged-Lepton Lane

This directory is the active `/particles` charged-lepton completion lane.

The live chain is:

1. read back the current ordered charged package on the local family
2. certify that the current support is exhausted
3. expose the minimal beyond-support extension scalar
4. turn the ordered coefficients into the charged excitation-gap map
5. build the log-spectrum readout
6. attach the scale/norm lane and emit the forward charged candidate

## Frozen Stage-5 Postdiction Audit

The historical Stage-5 formula has been preserved as a reproducible
postdiction, separate from the theorem-grade completion lane:

- `derive_charged_stage5_frozen_candidate.py` freezes the legacy
  `P = 1.63094` branch and emits
  `(m_e,m_mu,m_tau) = (0.510882243295, 105.635282871,
  1776.579124017) MeV`, with maximum comparison error `0.02284%`.
- `audit_charged_stage5_frozen_candidate.py` records that the same formula on
  the current public-pixel probe has maximum error `0.08347%`, and that no
  charged RG/threshold map to the compared pole-mass scheme is supplied.
- `derive_charged_z3_maxent_balance_audit.py` proves the conditional block
  identity and records the counterresult: natural trace MaxEnt weights the
  real singlet and charged doublet as `1:2`. Koide balance needs a separately
  derived one-bit compensation and an ensemble-to-Yukawa bridge.
- `derive_charged_z3_phase_holonomy_no_go.py` certifies that the arithmetic
  identity `2/9` is not a family-holonomy theorem. Hypercharge acts as a common
  generation phase and does not generate the cyclic family shift.

The frozen formula does not read charged reference masses at runtime, but its
balanced carrier, phase, exponent prescription, `2^(1/6)` normalization,
determinant attachment, family assignment, and mass-scheme bridge are not
derived from current OPH axioms. It is therefore an accurate historical
postdiction, not a promoted prediction.

## Scoped Non-Identifiability And Exact Port Frontier

- `derive_charged_current_oph_moduli_independence.py` binds the relevant
  structural receipts and proves a carefully scoped result. D9 charged-channel
  admissibility, fixed D10 `P,v(P)`, and invariant 12/24 data permit the exact
  family
  `diag(exp(mu+x), exp(mu+y), exp(mu-x-y))`; they do not select its two centered
  coordinates or common affine coordinate. Mass-dependent electromagnetic
  endpoint transport is explicitly outside this scope.
- `derive_charged_a5_w5_port_frontier.py` proves
  `R^12 = W1 + W3 + W3' + W5`, constructs
  `P5=(I+A_antipode)/2-11^T/12`, and verifies
  `Q^*Q=(8/5)P5`. Only a source-emitted `W5` port record can feed the traceless
  quadrupole. The current uniform 12-port load and count-only 24-slot
  orientation data have zero `W5` projection.
- Three geometric lines require the strict discriminant gate
  `(tr Q^2)^3/2-3(tr Q^3)^2>0`. Physical charged lines additionally require a
  source-defined generation-space `A5` action and a normalized, signed
  intertwiner. Absolute masses still require `log|det Y_e|` and a declared mass
  scheme.

These are negative/frontier theorems for the current source signature, not a
claim that every future OPH extension must fail.

## How To Read The Active Charged-Lepton Files

The live charged scripts use the same compact derivation header:

- `Chain role`: where the file sits between the shared flavor carrier and the
  forward charged candidate
- `Mathematics`: which ordered-gap, support-rank, or spectral step it performs
- `OPH-derived inputs`: which values are inherited directly from the active
  `/particles` flavor/lepton artifacts
- `Output`: the emitted artifact and, when applicable, the exact missing scalar

The active charged completion tail is:

- `derive_charged_sector_local_current_support_obstruction_certificate.py`
- `derive_charged_sector_local_minimal_source_support_extension_emitter.py`
- `derive_lepton_excitation_gap_map.py`
- `derive_lepton_log_spectrum_readout.py`
- `build_forward_charged_leptons.py`

Current scripts:

- [`derive_charged_sector_local_current_support_obstruction_certificate.py`](derive_charged_sector_local_current_support_obstruction_certificate.py)
- [`derive_charged_sector_local_minimal_source_support_extension_emitter.py`](derive_charged_sector_local_minimal_source_support_extension_emitter.py)
- [`derive_lepton_excitation_gap_map.py`](derive_lepton_excitation_gap_map.py)
- [`derive_lepton_log_spectrum_readout.py`](derive_lepton_log_spectrum_readout.py)
- [`build_forward_charged_leptons.py`](build_forward_charged_leptons.py)
- [`test_no_koide_import.py`](test_no_koide_import.py)
- [`test_no_experiment_label_matching.py`](test_no_experiment_label_matching.py)
- [`test_channel_norm_not_fit.py`](test_channel_norm_not_fit.py)
- [`test_ratio_only_not_promoted.py`](test_ratio_only_not_promoted.py)

These scripts do **not** claim charged leptons are theorem-level. They
give the `e30` closure lane a concrete local home under `/particles`, and they
keep the ordered-shape/hierarchy problem separate from absolute-scale closure.

Current same-carrier constructive blocker:

- `eta_source_support_extension_log_per_side`

Theorem-facing absolute route:

- `oph_generation_bundle_branch_generator_splitting`
- `refinement_stable_uncentered_trace_lift`
- then the determinant-line section and `A_ch` are induced data

Operator-side exact obstruction certificate:

- `oph_generation_bundle_branch_generator_splitting_obstruction_certificate`
  This fixes the current operator-side claim boundary sharply: the displayed
  proxy ordered spectrum together with the displayed level-0 and level-1
  projector system does not force the descended-commutator clause. The
  obstruction witness is the nonzero natural centered commutator with operator
  norm `0.04861550547372144` against projector defect
  `0.06363734112184061`, so the displayed current data do not imply exact
  vanishing or uniform quadratic smallness after the central split.

The post-promotion lift slot is packaged in carrier form:

- `oph_charged_uncentered_trace_lift_cocycle_reduction`
  This keeps the single-slot frontier unchanged while making its exact content
  explicit: after centered promotion, the ambiguity is one scalar
  affine cocycle primitive `mu`, with `C_tilde_e = C_hat_e + mu I`,
  `s_det = 3 mu`, and `A_ch = mu`.

- `oph_charged_mu_physical_descent_reduction`
  This expresses the same carrier one step further under the same refinement-
  stability contract required by the lift: on theorem-grade physical
  `Y_e`, the refinement cocycle vanishes and the exact residual object is one
  physical affine scalar `mu_phys(Y_e)`.

- `oph_charged_centered_operator_mu_phys_no_go`
  This closes the false post-promotion shortcut: even a theorem-grade centered
  `C_hat_e` cannot emit `mu_phys(Y_e)` by itself, because centered operator
  data is invariant under the common-shift action that `mu_phys` breaks.

- `oph_charged_p_to_affine_anchor_reduction`
  This fixes the smallest supported bridge target for the `P`-driven absolute
  lane. A theorem-grade landing from the D10 descendants of `P` on theorem-
  grade physical `Y_e(P)` or on the charged determinant line forces
  `A_ch(P) = (1/3) * log|det(Y_e(P))|`, so the bridge target is smaller than a
  free-standing affine-scalar theorem.

  The same descent package also gives a sharper P-threaded reformulation:
  once `P -> Y_e(P)` lands on theorem-grade physical charged data and the
  post-promotion charged descent hypotheses hold, the physical affine scalar
  `mu_phys(Y_e(P))` is forced by the identity-mode equalizer and does not form
  a separate bridge-sized theorem.

- `oph_charged_determinant_character_frontier`
  This records the proposed source-facing charged frontier. The present
  `q_e = sqrt(g_e d_e)` values are template-dependent refinement-arrow defects,
  not an independently descended nonzero same-object multiplicative character;
  the identity arrow gives `q=0`, so its logarithm is not finite. Therefore the
  candidate expression `S_M = sum_e M_e^ch log q_e` does not yet define a
  physical determinant character on the realized support. The formal no-go
  isolates one additive determinant normalization
  attaching that source-side character to the physical charged determinant
  line. Equivalently, the exact smaller theorem is the sector-
  isolated trace-lift attachment
  `3 mu(r) = sum_e M_e^ch log q_e(r)` on the charged determinant channel, not
  a fresh mass ansatz and not an end-to-end charged closure.

- `oph_charged_determinant_trace_normalization_no_go`
  This packages the formal underdetermination theorem behind the new charged
  frontier wording. The current corpus fixes the populated source-side
  determinant character and the post-promotion identity-mode equalizer
  separately, and it leaves one additive determinant normalization defect
  `N_det(P) = s_det(P) - sum_e M_e^ch log q_e(P)` unresolved.

- `oph_charged_trace_lift_theorem`
  This is the fail-closed issue-546 gate. It audits the proposed central-sector
  factorization, the uncentered lift constant, and the interval for `N_det`.
  On the current corpus it emits `no_go_confirmed_new_source_needed`: `M_ch`
  is only formal, the numerical `q_psi` arrow readback is source-open and not
  stage-indexed, and the D10 matter-determinant landing is conditional. A D9
  representation-role projector does isolate a supplied charged Yukawa channel
  with exact zero quark leakage, but it neither attaches D10 nor normalizes the
  determinant line. The exact countermodel `Y_e -> exp(kappa) Y_e` preserves all
  declared antecedents and ratios while shifting `log|det Y_e|` by `3 kappa`;
  the proposed reference-stage `q` also fails to provide a finite trivialization.
  The ledger may flip only for a source-only certificate with zero leakage and
  a singleton residual interval `[0, 0]`; an interval merely containing zero
  remains non-promoting.

- `oph_charged_physical_class_affine_scalar_reduction`
  This is the strongest supported selected-surface charged theorem packaged on the
  current local surface. It does not claim a quark-style public selected-class
  charged source descent. It states that on theorem-grade physical charged
  `Y_e(P)`, once theorem-grade `C_hat_e` exists, the determinant line fixes the
  canonical physical affine scalar `mu_phys(Y_e(P)) = (1/3) * log|det(Y_e(P))|`
  and therefore the canonical uncentered lift, determinant-line, affine-anchor,
  and charged mass formulas.

- `oph_charged_physical_determinant_line_canonical_uncentered_lift`
  This is the exact conditional theorem behind `#151`: on theorem-grade
  physical charged `Y_e`, theorem-grade `C_hat_e` and the determinant line
  canonically fix
  `C_tilde_e(Y_e) = C_hat_e(Y_e) + mu_phys(Y_e) I`
  with
  `mu_phys(Y_e) = (1/3) * log|det(Y_e)|`.
  The identity-mode equalizer on a fixed physical fiber is then tautological.

- `oph_charged_mass_readout_from_affine_anchor`
  This is the exact downstream theorem beneath the source-landing frontier:
  once theorem-grade `A_ch(P)` exists on theorem-grade physical charged data,
  the charged absolute scale and charged mass triple are pure algebraic
  readouts,
  `g_e(P) = exp(A_ch(P))` and
  `m_i(P) = exp(A_ch(P) + ell_i_centered(P))`.
  The charged source theorem is the determinant trace-lift attachment / zero-
  normalization identity beneath the broader landing from the D10 calibration
  descendants of `P` to theorem-grade physical charged data or the charged
  determinant line.

- `oph_charged_determinant_trace_lift_attachment_required`
  This is the explicit missing-theorem gate for public charged-lepton masses.
  The downstream map `A_ch(P) -> m_e,m_mu,m_tau` is algebraic, but the live
  corpus does not prove `P -> A_ch(P)`. Promotion requires
  `3*A_ch(P)=sum_psi M_ch[psi]*log(q_psi(P))` with source-emitted `M_ch`,
  source-emitted same-label `q_psi(P)`, and a no-target-leak parent DAG.

Layered frontier ledger on disk:

- `oph_charged_absolute_frontier_factorization`
  This separates the current-surface missing affine object `A_ch` from the
  strictly smaller post-promotion single slot `refinement_stable_uncentered_trace_lift`.

Smaller same-carrier primitive on disk:

- `oph_charged_sector_local_support_extension_source_scalar_pair_readback`
  This collects the ordered `eta` then `sigma` invariant readbacks beneath the
  full support-extension shell without promoting either scalar value.

That is the first charged scalar that leaves the exhausted current
support and changes the hierarchy. Without it, the forward charged
artifact remains a structured gap surface rather than a promotable prediction.

The theorem-facing absolute tail lies above that same-carrier frontier.
Once the latent centered charged operator is promoted, the supported post-promotion
single slot is the refinement-stable uncentered trace lift. The determinant-line
section and affine absolute anchor `A_ch` then follow as induced data.
