# OPH Code

This directory is the canonical code surface for OPH derivation work.

Primary derivation surfaces:

- `P_derivation/`: compressed `P -> alpha` closure and fixed-point artifacts.
- `particles/`: particle-spectrum builders, status surfaces, gap campaigns, and
  the electroweak hierarchy certificate bundle under `particles/hierarchy/`.
- `consensus/`: packet-net, consensus-protocol, and fixed-cutoff Z2/S3 reference-architecture benchmark artifacts.
- `geometry/`: machine receipts for the Einstein branch-entry packets (GitHub
  #523/#524/#525): the quotient-intrinsic incidence/cap readout with its
  topology countermodels, the null-net standardness and Markov modular-locality
  witnesses (including the Gibbs nonlocality counterexample), and the synthetic
  end-to-end event-manifold reconstruction with its dimension/Hausdorff
  countermodels, plus the Einstein-closure receipts (#526-#528, #503): null
  tomography of the stress tensor, the exact first-law split with edge term,
  the MaxEnt multiplier identity, baseline countermodels, and the
  realized-branch receipt evaluation
  (`python3 code/geometry/realized_branch_receipts.py` writes
  `code/geometry/runs/realized_branch_receipt_report.json`), and the realized
  cyclic cap-net repair run (`python3 code/geometry/cyclic_cap_net_run.py`):
  a genuine transactional repair tower whose repaired output passes the
  spherical-incidence/mesh/naturality receipts under explicit branch
  selection, with the modular receipt families pending. Current verdict:
  realized geometric branch not certified nonempty. Run with
  `python3 -m pytest code/geometry/`.

Supplemental and benchmark surfaces:

- `dark_matter/`: pre-likelihood dark-sector simulation and likelihood scaffolds
  for the dark-matter supplement.
- `ibm_quantum_cloud/`: completed IBM hardware benchmark scripts and redacted
  raw-result JSON for OPH-inspired reduced-sector states. This is a benchmark
  bundle, not a theorem input to the particle or cosmology papers.

For the reference-architecture benchmark suite:

```bash
python3 code/consensus/reference_architecture_benchmark_suite.py
python3 -m pytest code/consensus/test_reference_architecture_benchmark_suite.py
```

The emitted artifact is `code/consensus/runs/reference_architecture_benchmark_suite_current.json`.

For the particle program, start with:

```bash
cd particles
python3 compute_current_output_table.py --no-print-table --show-paths
python3 scripts/build_derivation_gap_ledger.py
```

The particle gap campaign lives at `particles/campaigns/gap_bundle/`.
