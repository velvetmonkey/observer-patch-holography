# OPH Code

This directory is the canonical code surface for OPH derivation work.

Primary derivation surfaces:

- `P_derivation/`: compressed `P -> alpha` closure and fixed-point artifacts.
- `particles/`: particle-spectrum builders, status surfaces, gap campaigns, and
  the electroweak hierarchy certificate bundle under `particles/hierarchy/`.
- `consensus/`: packet-net, consensus-protocol, and fixed-cutoff Z2/S3 reference-architecture benchmark artifacts.
- `geometry/`: machine receipts for the Einstein branch-entry packets
  (GitHub #503, #523-#528). The suite covers the quotient-intrinsic
  incidence/cap readout with its topology countermodels, the null-net
  standardness and Markov modular-locality witnesses (including the Gibbs
  nonlocality counterexample), the synthetic event reconstruction with its
  dimension and Hausdorff countermodels, the realized cyclic cap-net repair
  run, the free-fermion modular-clock instrumentation (120-digit arc
  entanglement Hamiltonians, resummed velocity profiles), the null-net
  receipt instrumentation (half-sided compression, modular Lie closure),
  the realized-event receipts, and the bulk-depth channel with its
  Lorentzian (1,3) cone verdict and (2,2) strong-coupling countermodel.  The
  issue-307 collar-recoverability artifact evaluates the finite consequences
  of a declared strong conditional/matrix-mixing envelope, including the
  boundary-aware scaling rate and a counterexample to width-ratio scaling
  alone; it is an analytic proxy, not empirical evidence for that envelope.
  Machine state: sphere/mesh/naturality receipts pass on a genuine repair
  run under explicit branch selection; boundary-collar modular receipts
  pass; null-net receipts pass at one-particle level; realized records
  produce (1,2) and (1,3) causal cones; cone-margin convergence, limit
  clauses, cap-interior data, and the physical-identification receipts are
  work in progress, and the realized geometric branch is not certified
  nonempty. Reports live in `code/geometry/runs/`. Run with
  `python3 -m pytest code/geometry/` (needs numpy, scipy, mpmath).
- `dark_matter/`: pre-likelihood dark-sector simulation and likelihood scaffolds
  for the dark-matter supplement.
- `ibm_quantum_cloud/`: completed IBM hardware benchmark scripts and redacted
  raw-result JSON for OPH-inspired reduced-sector states. This is a benchmark
  bundle, not a theorem input to the particle or cosmology papers.

For the reference-architecture benchmark suite:

```bash
python3 code/consensus/reference_architecture_benchmark_suite.py
python3 -m pytest code/consensus/test_reference_architecture_benchmark_suite.py
```

The emitted artifact is `code/consensus/runs/reference_architecture_benchmark_suite_current.json`.

For the particle program, start with:

```bash
cd particles
python3 compute_current_output_table.py --no-print-table --show-paths
python3 scripts/build_derivation_gap_ledger.py
```

The particle gap campaign lives at `particles/campaigns/gap_bundle/`.
