"""Realized cyclic cap-net repair run for the #503 nonemptiness gate.

This module executes a genuine finite transactional OPH repair run --- real
seeded conflicts, transactional majority repair, runtime-verified termination,
confluence, and schedule independence (the node-D1 clauses checked at run
time, as in the #238 rooted-tree export) --- on a refinement tower of cyclic
cap nets, and exports the repaired record layer as a consensus artifact for
the realized-branch receipt evaluation.

Provenance is stated exactly: the overlap net of each stage is CHOSEN to be a
sphere triangulation (icosahedron plus edge subdivisions). Per the
dimension-selection boundary of the compact paper
(Corollary `cor:dimension-selection-status`), this is explicit branch
selection --- allowed as a named branch input, never claimed as a consensus
output. What the run genuinely witnesses is the joint realizability of the
node-D1 repair clauses with the spherical-incidence, mesh, and
refinement-naturality receipts on one tower: the repair layer does not know
the topology, and the incidence complex is recomputed from the repaired
normal-form records alone.

NOT witnessed here: the modular cross-ratio receipt and the geometric
2pi-KMS receipt, which require modular-clock instrumentation of the MaxEnt
states on this tower and remain pending; and the E/MI/scale/UC/VR families.
