"""Realized-branch receipt evaluation for the Einstein branch-entry gate (#503).

Evaluates the decidable incidence receipts of the compact paper's
geometry-producer packet (Definition `def:spherical-incidence-receipt`) on the
currently exported realized consensus artifacts, and emits the machine status
consumed by Remark `rem:realized-branch-status`:

* the verified rooted-tree packet-net domain (issue #238 export) is the only
  repair domain with a full correctness export to date; its overlap structure
  is a tree, so the support-visible incidence complex has no 2-simplices,
  Euler characteristic 1, and fails the spherical incidence receipt --- the
  realized geometric branch is NOT certified nonempty by it;
* a designed cellulated-sphere mesh (icosahedron) passes the receipt but is
  declared geometry, not a consensus product, and is labeled as such.

Run:
    python3 code/geometry/realized_branch_receipts.py
writes code/geometry/runs/realized_branch_receipt_report.json.
