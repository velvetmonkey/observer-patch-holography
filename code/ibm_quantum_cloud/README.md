# IBM Quantum Cloud Bundle

This directory is the public code-and-data bundle for the IBM Quantum Cloud OPH experiments.

It contains two things:

- `programs/`: the final runnable scripts used for the public hardware benchmark bundle
- `qc_data/`: representative raw JSON outputs from the completed hardware runs

## Scope

These experiments are best read as IBM hardware consistency benchmarks for OPH-inspired reduced-sector states.

They show that:

- the Stage 1 recoverability benchmark behaves in the OPH-favored direction on two real backends;
- the `Z_3` reduced-sector sanity check passes cleanly;
- `Z_5` repeatedly lands near the OPH golden-ratio target on `ibm_marrakesh`;
- `S_3` exposes a real layout-dependent hardware bias, and the corrected layout restores the nonabelian target ratio near `2`.

They do **not** yet amount to a complete standalone confirmation of the full OPH framework.

## Layout

- `programs/ibm_runtime_common.py`
  Shared IBM Runtime helper utilities.
- `programs/check_ibm_setup.py`
  Auth and backend-discovery verifier.
- `programs/discrete_heatkernel_test.py`
  `Z_3`, `Z_5`, and `S_3` reduced-sector runner.
- `programs/s3_diagnostic_bundle.py`
  `S_3` layout and readout diagnostic bundle.
- `programs/stage1_markov_fingerprint.py`
  3-qubit Markov / recoverability benchmark.
- `qc_data/README.md`
  Index of the public result artifacts.

## Re-running

The credential file is not part of this repo. The scripts expect a local note file with a line of the form:

```text
IBM cloud API key: <YOUR_API_KEY>
```

Pass it explicitly with `--credentials-file` if it is not in the current working directory.

Example commands:

```bash
python3 code/ibm_quantum_cloud/programs/check_ibm_setup.py --credentials-file /path/to/IBM_cloud.txt

python3 code/ibm_quantum_cloud/programs/discrete_heatkernel_test.py \
  --group z3 \
  --mode hardware \
  --backend ibm_marrakesh \
  --shots 4096 \
  --outdir code/ibm_quantum_cloud/qc_data/z3/rerun_example \
  --credentials-file /path/to/IBM_cloud.txt

python3 code/ibm_quantum_cloud/programs/s3_diagnostic_bundle.py \
  --mode hardware \
  --backend ibm_marrakesh \
  --t-value 0.60 \
  --shots 8192 \
  --use-best-pair-layout \
  --outdir code/ibm_quantum_cloud/qc_data/s3/rerun_example \
  --credentials-file /path/to/IBM_cloud.txt
```

## Notes

- The Stage 1 JSON exports keep the original job IDs and measured outputs, but account-specific instance CRNs are redacted in this public copy.
- The raw JSON is intentionally preserved in its original schema so readers can inspect the measured values directly.
