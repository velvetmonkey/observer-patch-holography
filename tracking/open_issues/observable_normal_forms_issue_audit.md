# Observation-Determined Normal Forms: open GitHub issue audit

Final live snapshot date: 2026-07-11  
Repository audited: FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography  
Draft audited for issue mapping: pro/observable_normal_forms_submission_bundle.zip  
Current repo-native paper: extra/observable_normal_forms.tex  
Audit mode: read-only GitHub review; no issue, label, milestone, project, or comment was changed

## Retrieval receipt and state drift

The final live inventory was retrieved with the authenticated GitHub CLI:

~~~sh
gh auth status
gh issue list \
  --repo FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography \
  --state open \
  --limit 1000 \
  --json number,title,url,body,labels,milestone,assignees,comments,createdAt,updatedAt
~~~

The final query returned 115 open issues. Of these, 60 carry the
physics-problems label and 55 are proof packets, publication tasks,
continuation items, or repository-specific theorem tasks. The inventory below
covers all 115 currently open issues.

State-drift receipt: an earlier query on the same date returned 112. During this
work, #293, #303, #368, #454, and #492 changed independently to closed. They are not
included in the final open inventory; #505 and #506--#512 were created
independently during final verification and are included. This report makes no claim that the
Observation-Determined Normal Forms paper caused any state change.

## Executive verdict

The Observation-Determined Normal Forms manuscript, by itself, justifies
closing none of the 115 issues in the final live snapshot.

Five issues receive a direct but incomplete mathematical advance:

- [#304](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/304):
  the paper separates same-input confluence from same-boundary reconstruction
  and proves the exact generic equivalence between boundary identification
  modulo a silent relation and cross-source endpoint uniqueness modulo that
  relation;
- [#305](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/305):
  finite observation-fiber resampling is proved to be the weighted conditional
  expectation, with its projection, fixed-space, and contraction properties and
  a noncircular matrix-recognition receipt;
- [#312](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/312):
  the equivariant-section theorem supplies a rigorous generic selection
  firewall, but no compact-gauge or Standard Model selection theorem;
- [#326](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/326):
  the finite Markov drift proposition turns a row-wise kernel inequality into
  expectation, endpoint-tail, stationary, and expected-occupation receipts,
  but does not prove pathwise long-interval confinement or instantiate the
  exported patch-net matrix;
- [#328](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/328):
  ranked functional-audit systems now settle synchronously in dependency depth,
  and acyclic Boolean circuits now compile explicitly into that class, but the
  named scatter-project correspondence remains absent.

The manuscript must remain OPH-neutral. This issue audit is an external
crosswalk, not material to import into the paper. The chi_nu_test work is
relevant only as mathematical architecture context. Nothing in this paper
closes or advances a physical susceptibility, source, device, lift,
dark-sector, or experiment claim.

## Evidence levels used in this audit

| Level | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Paper theorem | A theorem is proved in the manuscript. |
| Lean-backed theorem | The exact advertised statement compiles in the dedicated, pinned artifact with a clean axiom report. |
| Application bridge | The abstract theorem's hypotheses are proved for the named finite system or model. |
| OPH-specific claim | The downstream physical or public claim follows with its model-specific hypotheses and receipts. |

The observation-preservation counterexample, cross-source identification
equivalence, synchronous dependency-depth theorem, and finite weighted
conditional-resampling projection are Lean-backed in the standalone artifact.
The finite Markov drift-iteration and endpoint-tail core is Lean-backed, while
its complete kernel-law/support wrapper is only partially packaged.  The R1--R3
matrix recognition converse is proved in the paper but is not yet formalized.
None of these generic results is automatically an application bridge merely
because its notation resembles an OPH issue.

## Classification key

| Code | Classification | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| M | Modify / direct advance | The manuscript materially advances the issue, but does not satisfy all acceptance criteria. |
| A | Adjacent / addable | A focused OPH-neutral addition could address the issue's mathematical core. |
| C | Context only | The paper supplies useful vocabulary, a warning, or a supporting lemma, but no issue acceptance criterion is completed. |
| U | Unaffected | The issue needs domain-specific mathematics, physics, computation, evidence, or publication work absent from the paper. |

Counts in the 115-row live inventory: M = 5, A = 0, C = 6, U = 104.

## Detailed candidate analysis

### #304 Boundary-Fiber Identifiability — modify, do not close

What the repo-native paper now supplies:

- the trichotomy into unrealizable, singleton, and ambiguous observation fibers;
- a partial normalizer and universal property for injectivity of the observation
  map on the consistent set;
- an exact theorem saying that, under observation preservation and
  \(\operatorname{NF}=C\), the boundary identifies consistent states modulo an
  arbitrary silent relation if and only if normal endpoints reached from every
  pair of equally observed sources agree modulo that relation;
- the corresponding injectivity criterion on the silent quotient;
- an explicit separation of same-source confluence, cross-source
  identification, weak normalization, and all-schedule liveness;
- observation preservation, completeness, singleton consistent fiber, and weak
  normalization as the hypotheses for one normal form and fiberwise confluence;
- a linear quotient criterion identifying the consistent quotient when the
  boundary kernel equals the gauge subspace;
- proper and deficient Rule 90 information-boundary examples;
- an explicit three-state counterexample showing that a singleton consistent
  fiber does not help when a rewrite changes the protected observation, and an
  aligned two-bit positive witness for the separated notions.

Evidence status:

- the cross-source equivalence, counterexample, and two-bit separation are
  Lean-backed paper theorems and examples;
- issue comments report a machine-checked boundary_fiber_observer_unique theorem
  and Rule 90 witnesses already merged into the repository;
- no application bridge establishes injectivity of the declared physical
  boundary map on the actual OPH consistent quotient.

Remaining work is the concrete statement that equal declared physical
boundary/sector data on two consistent states imply gauge equivalence, plus any
downstream compact-paper and public-surface updates. Record the neutral paper as
the generic theorem layer, but keep #304 open for the model-specific bridge.

### #312 Gauge Classification and Selection Separation — modify, do not close

The equivariant-section criterion and stabilizer obstruction show that an
ambiguous fiber cannot be collapsed equivariantly unless a stabilizer-fixed
representative exists. This is a clean, substrate-neutral theorem explaining why
normalization or classification does not silently provide a selection law.

It does not prove Doplicher-Roberts/Tannakian compact-gauge reconstruction,
discharge the Standard Model selection hypotheses, prove anomaly or
matter-package results, or update simulator gate language. It is a supporting
selection firewall, not closure of #312.

### #305 Finite Quotient Repair Projection — modify, do not close

The paper now proves the finite abstract projection core requested by #305. On
a finite full-support weighted space, it defines resampling from the conditional
weight inside each observation fiber and proves that the induced operator is
the conditional expectation onto observation-measurable functions. It is
idempotent, weighted self-adjoint, \(L^2\)-contractive, and its fixed space is
exactly the observation-measurable subspace. These properties are Lean-backed,
including an exact weighted Pythagorean identity.

The paper also states a non-tautological R1--R3 recognition certificate: an
independently extracted transition matrix must preserve fibers, have rows equal
within a fiber, and satisfy weighted detailed balance. Those checks force the
matrix to equal the conditional-resampling kernel. The receipt explicitly
forbids constructing the tested matrix from the target conditional-expectation
formula.

This resolves the substrate-neutral mathematical core, but not the live issue
as a repository application task. The actual repair matrix must still be
extracted from the named local transitions, checked against R1--R3, and carried
through the compact/main paper and downstream claim surfaces. Keep #305 open
until that application receipt and propagation exist.

### #326 Finite Markov-Kernel Fair-Block Certificate — modify, do not close

The repo-native paper now proves a finite Markov drift receipt. Given a finite
kernel K and a nonnegative V satisfying

  KV <= kappa V + xi, with 0 <= kappa < 1,

it derives the geometric expectation bound and a one-time endpoint tail bound by
Markov's inequality. When V is the residual and kernel support preserves the
observation, the endpoint event supplies the settling receipt consumed by the
paper's schedule-independence theorem. The premise is a finite row-wise matrix
inequality.

The stationary corollary additionally bounds stationary mean residual, and a
finite-horizon consequence bounds expected occupation outside a tube. These are
distributional/expectation statements, not an infinite-horizon sample-path
confinement result.

This materially advances #326, but the issue asks for long-run tube behavior
under bounded excursions and for a concrete finite-matrix receipt extracted
from the exported quotient dynamics. Pathwise confinement needs an additional
excursion, maximal-inequality, or concentration theorem, and the application
matrix remains to be supplied.

### #328 Uniform Settling for Compiled Boolean Lattices — modify, do not close

The ranked functional-audit class gives singleton-or-empty fibers, termination
of effective asynchronous updates, and now a synchronous theorem: after k
parallel rounds, all sites through rank k agree with the generated extension, so
the explicit ranked system settles in dependency depth. The paper also gives an
explicit compiler for acyclic Boolean circuits: inputs and constants occupy
rank zero, one finite-state site represents each gate, and gate rank is its
dependency depth.

This is a useful acyclic constraint-system result, but it does not close #328:

1. correspondence between the paper's synchronous functional update and the
   named scatter-project dynamics is absent;
2. the asynchronous quantity M(v) can count dependency paths and need not be
   polynomial in a succinct DAG, while the synchronous depth result applies only
   after the ranked representation is explicitly given.

The paper's compiler theorem closes the neutral compiler step.  It correctly
leaves correspondence with the named application update rule to a separate
theorem.

### Context-only issues that must not be overread

- [#295](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/295):
  the conditional-resampling theorem supplies a finite local projector that a
  repair-gap argument may consume, and the nonuniform-conditioning examples
  expose hidden refinement degeneration, but the paper provides no
  active-collar classification, positive rate floor, or spectral comparison.
- [#298](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/298):
  finite normal-form and refinement language may support a cautious demo
  description, but the paper proves no three-body or holonomy result.
- [#306](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/306):
  the finite projection theorem and Lipschitz telescoping of normalizer defects
  are not a Poincare inequality, spectral-gap lower-semicontinuity, or GNS
  transfer theorem.
- [#325](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/325):
  a residual/boundary solver receipt is not a hardware evidence bundle and says
  nothing about hashes, calibration, negative controls, or hidden lab state.
- [#327](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/327):
  a classical linear information-set criterion is not a topological QECC
  realization, homological distance theorem, commuting-projector model, or
  quantum recovery map.
- [#503](https://github.com/FloatingPragma/observer-patch-holography/issues/503):
  #304 is one child gate only. The paper supplies none of the geometric,
  modular, stress, entropy, coupling, or all-observer hypotheses required for
  Einstein branch entry.

## Remaining application or stronger additions

The compact neutral additions authorized for this pass are now in the paper.
The remaining work either needs an application bridge outside this paper or a
materially stronger neutral theorem.

1. For #305, extract the application repair matrix from actual local
   transitions, check the paper's R1--R3 receipt, and propagate the resulting
   status through the core surfaces. This is no longer missing generic
   mathematics in this paper.
2. If #326 is to be advanced further, add a separate pathwise
   theorem under explicit bounded-jump or bounded-excursion assumptions. Keep
   expected distance, one-time endpoint tails, interval maxima, and stationary
   tube statements distinct.
3. For #328, prove the application-level dynamics correspondence. The neutral
   acyclic circuit compiler and dependency-depth theorem should not be relabeled
   as a scatter-project theorem without that bridge.
4. Retain scope firewalls: a solver receipt is not hardware provenance; a
   finite-field information-set theorem is not a topological QECC theorem; and
   an inverse-limit normalizer does not construct a continuum measure, field
   theory, or GNS representation.

## Neutrality status

The original supplied bundle used for the initial issue mapping contained
OPH-specific material. The current repo-native source at
extra/observable_normal_forms.tex has been cleaned. A 2026-07-11 self-check
found zero matches for OPH, Observer-Patch Holography, the former OPH
bibliography keys, sec:oph, observer-overlap, or the former OPH-specific
phrases. It now carries no OPH-specific text or citations.

The issue crosswalk in this report remains the correct place to record
downstream relevance. Regeneration from the original bundle must not reintroduce
the removed application section or citations into the neutral paper.

## Recommended tracking actions

1. Do not infer issue closure solely because this paper is added.
2. On #304, cite the exact generic equivalence when release-ready, but retain
   the concrete physical boundary-injectivity gate.
3. On #305, record that the mathematical projection core and matrix-recognition
   receipt are complete, but retain the extracted-transition and downstream
   propagation gates.
4. On #312, #326, and #328, record the exact paper theorem and the remaining
   acceptance criteria; do not mark them complete on this paper alone.
5. Keep all physical chi_nu, source, device, susceptibility, lift, and experiment
   issues unchanged.
6. Regenerate the open-state portion of this audit before any issue-status action
   because GitHub is the live source of truth.
